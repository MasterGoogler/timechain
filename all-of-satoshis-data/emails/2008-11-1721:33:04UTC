   I mean a node only needs the pending-tx pool for the best branch it
   has. The branch that it currently thinks is the best branch.
   That's the branch it'll be trying to make a block out of, which is
   all it needs the pool for.

   I think I've got the peer networking broadcast mechanism covered.
   Each node sends its neighbours an inventory list of hashes of the
   new blocks and transactions it has. The neighbours request the
   items they don't have yet. If the item never comes through after a
   timeout, they request it from another neighbour that had it. Since
   all or most of the neighbours should eventually have each item,
   even if the coms get fumbled up with one, they can get it from any
   of the others, trying one at a time.
   The inventory-request-data scheme introduces a little latency, but
   it ultimately helps speed more by keeping extra data blocks off the
   transmit queues and conserving bandwidth.

   I believe I've worked through all those little details over the
   last year and a half while coding it, and there were a lot of them.
   The functional details are not covered in the paper, but the
   sourcecode is coming soon. I sent you the main files.
