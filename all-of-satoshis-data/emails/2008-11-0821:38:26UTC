   Increasing hardware speed is handled: "To compensate for increasing
   hardware
   speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the
   proof-of-work
   difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average
   number of
   blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty
   increases."
   As computers get faster and the total computing power applied to
   creating
   bitcoins increases, the difficulty increases proportionally to keep the
   total
   new production constant. Thus, it is known in advance how many new
   bitcoins
   will be created every year in the future.
   The fact that new coins are produced means the money supply increases
   by a
   planned amount, but this does not necessarily result in inflation. If
   the
   supply of money increases at the same rate that the number of people
   using it
   increases, prices remain stable. If it does not increase as fast as
   demand,
   there will be deflation and early holders of money will see its value
   increase.
   Coins have to get initially distributed somehow, and a constant rate
   seems like
   the best formula.
