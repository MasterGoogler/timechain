   They both broadcast their blocks. All nodes receive them and keep both,
   but
   only work on the one they received first. We'll suppose exactly half
   received
   one first, half the other.
   In a short time, all the transactions will finish propagating so that
   everyone
   has the full set. The nodes working on each side will be trying to add
   the
   transactions that are missing from their side. When the next
   proof-of-work is
   found, whichever previous block that node was working on, that branch
   becomes
   longer and the tie is broken. Whichever side it is, the new block will
   contain
   the other half of the transactions, so in either case, the branch will
   contain
   all transactions. Even in the unlikely event that a split happened
   twice in a
   row, both sides of the second split would contain the full set of
   transactions
   anyway.
   It's not a problem if transactions have to wait one or a few extra
   cycles to
   get into a block.
