   Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would
   be safe
   for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check
   for
   double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers,
   or
   about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need
   to run
   network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the
   network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to
   specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm
   would
   only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN
   connects with
   that one node.
   The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical
   transaction
   would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has
   to be
   broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37
   billion
   transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per
   day.
   That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12
   DVD or
   2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.
   If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and
   by then,
   sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a
   big deal.
