Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper 2008-11-01 23:16:33 UTC

   I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully
   peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.
   The paper is available at:
   http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
   The main properties:
   Double-spending is prevented with a peer-to-peer network.
   No mint or other trusted parties.
   Participants can be anonymous.
   New coins are made from Hashcash style proof-of-work.
   The proof-of-work for new coin generation also powers the
   network to prevent double-spending.
   Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
   Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would
   allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another
   without the burdens of going through a financial institution.
   Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
   benefits are lost if a trusted party is still required to prevent
   double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending
   problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps
   transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based
   proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without
   redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as
   proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came
   from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as honest nodes control
   the most CPU power on the network, they can generate the longest
   chain and outpace any attackers. The network itself requires
   minimal structure. Messages are broadcasted on a best effort basis,
   and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the
   longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they
   were gone.

   Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would
   be safe
   for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check
   for
   double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers,
   or
   about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need
   to run
   network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the
   network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to
   specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm
   would
   only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN
   connects with
   that one node.
   The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical
   transaction
   would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has
   to be
   broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37
   billion
   transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per
   day.
   That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12
   DVD or
   2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.
   If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and
   by then,
   sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a
   big deal.

   Thanks for bringing up that point.
   I didn't really make that statement as strong as I could have. The
   requirement
   is that the good guys collectively have more CPU power than any single
   attacker.
   There would be many smaller zombie farms that are not big enough to
   overpower
   the network, and they could still make money by generating bitcoins.
   The
   smaller farms are then the "honest nodes". (I need a better term than
   "honest") The more smaller farms resort to generating bitcoins, the
   higher the
   bar gets to overpower the network, making larger farms also too small
   to
   overpower it so that they may as well generate bitcoins too. According
   to the
   "long tail" theory, the small, medium and merely large farms put
   together
   should add up to a lot more than the biggest zombie farm.
   Even if a bad guy does overpower the network, it's not like he's
   instantly
   rich. All he can accomplish is to take back money he himself spent,
   like
   bouncing a check. To exploit it, he would have to buy something from a
   merchant, wait till it ships, then overpower the network and try to
   take his
   money back. I don't think he could make as much money trying to pull a
   carding
   scheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins. With a zombie farm
   that
   big, he could generate more bitcoins than everyone else combined.
   The Bitcoin network might actually reduce spam by diverting zombie
   farms to
   generating bitcoins instead.

   Yes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new
   territory of
   freedom for several years.
   Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled
   networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem
   to be
   holding their own.

   Increasing hardware speed is handled: "To compensate for increasing
   hardware
   speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the
   proof-of-work
   difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average
   number of
   blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty
   increases."
   As computers get faster and the total computing power applied to
   creating
   bitcoins increases, the difficulty increases proportionally to keep the
   total
   new production constant. Thus, it is known in advance how many new
   bitcoins
   will be created every year in the future.
   The fact that new coins are produced means the money supply increases
   by a
   planned amount, but this does not necessarily result in inflation. If
   the
   supply of money increases at the same rate that the number of people
   using it
   increases, prices remain stable. If it does not increase as fast as
   demand,
   there will be deflation and early holders of money will see its value
   increase.
   Coins have to get initially distributed somehow, and a constant rate
   seems like
   the best formula.

   Right, nodes keep transactions in their working set until they get into
   a
   block. If a transaction reaches 90% of nodes, then each time a new
   block is
   found, it has a 90% chance of being in it.

   That does not need to be checked for. The transaction in whichever
   branch ends
   up getting ahead becomes the valid one, the other is invalid. If
   someone tries
   to double spend like that, one and only one spend will always become
   valid, the
   others invalid.
   Receivers of transactions will normally need to hold transactions for
   perhaps
   an hour or more to allow time for this kind of possibility to be
   resolved.
   They can still re-spend the coins immediately, but they should wait
   before
   taking an action such as shipping goods.

   The attacker isn't adding blocks to the end. He has to go back and redo
   the
   block his transaction is in and all the blocks after it, as well as any
   new
   blocks the network keeps adding to the end while he's doing that. He's
   rewriting history. Once his branch is longer, it becomes the new valid
   one.
   This touches on a key point. Even though everyone present may see the
   shenanigans going on, there's no way to take advantage of that fact.
   It is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered
   the valid
   one. Nodes that were present may remember that one branch was there
   first and
   got replaced by another, but there would be no way for them to convince
   those
   who were not present of this. We can't have subfactions of nodes that
   cling to
   one branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch
   first, and
   others that joined later and never saw what happened. The CPU power
   proof-of-work vote must have the final say. The only way for everyone
   to stay
   on the same page is to believe that the longest chain is always the
   valid one,
   no matter what.

   The recipient just needs to verify it back to a depth that is
   sufficiently far
   back in the block chain, which will often only require a depth of 2
   transactions. All transactions before that can be discarded.

   Right, exactly. When a node receives a block, it checks the signatures
   of
   every transaction in it against previous transactions in blocks. Blocks
   can
   only contain transactions that depend on valid transactions in previous
   blocks
   or the same block. Transaction C could depend on transaction B in the
   same
   block and B depends on transaction A in an earlier block.

   I appreciate your questions. I actually did this kind of backwards. I
   had to
   write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve
   every
   problem, then I wrote the paper. I think I will be able to release the
   code
   sooner than I could write a detailed spec. You're already right about
   most of
   your assumptions where you filled in the blanks.

   The proof-of-work chain is the solution to the synchronisation problem,
   and to
   knowing what the globally shared view is without having to trust
   anyone.
   A transaction will quickly propagate throughout the network, so if two
   versions
   of the same transaction were reported at close to the same time, the
   one with
   the head start would have a big advantage in reaching many more nodes
   first.
   Nodes will only accept the first one they see, refusing the second one
   to
   arrive, so the earlier transaction would have many more nodes working
   on
   incorporating it into the next proof-of-work. In effect, each node
   votes for
   its viewpoint of which transaction it saw first by including it in its
   proof-of-work effort.
   If the transactions did come at exactly the same time and there was an
   even
   split, it's a toss up based on which gets into a proof-of-work first,
   and that
   decides which is valid.
   When a node finds a proof-of-work, the new block is propagated
   throughout the
   network and everyone adds it to the chain and starts working on the
   next block
   after it. Any nodes that had the other transaction will stop trying to
   include
   it in a block, since it's now invalid according to the accepted chain.
   The proof-of-work chain is itself self-evident proof that it came from
   the
   globally shared view. Only the majority of the network together has
   enough CPU
   power to generate such a difficult chain of proof-of-work. Any user,
   upon
   receiving the proof-of-work chain, can see what the majority of the
   network has
   approved. Once a transaction is hashed into a link that's a few links
   back in
   the chain, it is firmly etched into the global history.

   They both broadcast their blocks. All nodes receive them and keep both,
   but
   only work on the one they received first. We'll suppose exactly half
   received
   one first, half the other.
   In a short time, all the transactions will finish propagating so that
   everyone
   has the full set. The nodes working on each side will be trying to add
   the
   transactions that are missing from their side. When the next
   proof-of-work is
   found, whichever previous block that node was working on, that branch
   becomes
   longer and the tie is broken. Whichever side it is, the new block will
   contain
   the other half of the transactions, so in either case, the branch will
   contain
   all transactions. Even in the unlikely event that a split happened
   twice in a
   row, both sides of the second split would contain the full set of
   transactions
   anyway.
   It's not a problem if transactions have to wait one or a few extra
   cycles to
   get into a block.

   If you're having trouble with the inflation issue, it's easy to tweak
   it for
   transaction fees instead. It's as simple as this: let the output value
   from
   any transaction be 1 cent less than the input value. Either the client
   software automatically writes transactions for 1 cent more than the
   intended
   payment value, or it could come out of the payee's side. The incentive
   value
   when a node finds a proof-of-work for a block could be the total of the
   fees in
   the block.

   When there are multiple double-spent versions of the same transaction,
   one and
   only one will become valid.
   The receiver of a payment must wait an hour or so before believing that
   it's
   valid. The network will resolve any possible double-spend races by
   then.
   The guy who received the double-spend that became invalid never thought
   he had
   it in the first place. His software would have shown the transaction go
   from
   "unconfirmed" to "invalid". If necessary, the UI can be made to hide
   transactions until they're sufficiently deep in the block chain.

   Sorry if I didn't make that clear. The target time between blocks will
   probably be 10 minutes.
   Every block includes its creation time. If the time is off by more than
   36
   hours, other nodes won't work on it. If the timespan over the last
   6*24*30
   blocks is less than 15 days, blocks are being generated too fast and
   the
   proof-of-work difficulty doubles. Everyone does the same calculation
   with the
   same chain data, so they all get the same result at the same link in
   the chain.

   Instantant non-repudiability is not a feature, but it's still much
   faster than
   existing systems. Paper cheques can bounce up to a week or two later.
   Credit
   card transactions can be contested up to 60 to 180 days later. Bitcoin
   transactions can be sufficiently irreversible in an hour or two.

   With the transaction fee based incentive system I recently posted,
   nodes would
   have an incentive to include all the paying transactions they receive.

   The proof-of-work chain is a solution to the Byzantine Generals'
   Problem. I'll
   try to rephrase it in that context.
   A number of Byzantine Generals each have a computer and want to attack
   the
   King's wi-fi by brute forcing the password, which they've learned is a
   certain
   number of characters in length. Once they stimulate the network to
   generate a
   packet, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in
   and
   erase the logs, otherwise they will be discovered and get in trouble.
   They
   only have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of
   them attack
   at the same time.
   They don't particularly care when the attack will be, just that they
   all agree.
   It has been decided that anyone who feels like it will announce a time,
   and
   whatever time is heard first will be the official attack time. The
   problem is
   that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce
   different
   attack times at close to the same time, some may hear one first and
   others hear
   the other first.
   They use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem. Once each general
   receives whatever attack time he hears first, he sets his computer to
   solve an
   extremely difficult proof-of-work problem that includes the attack time
   in its
   hash. The proof-of-work is so difficult, it's expected to take 10
   minutes of
   them all working at once before one of them finds a solution. Once one
   of the
   generals finds a proof-of-work, he broadcasts it to the network, and
   everyone
   changes their current proof-of-work computation to include that
   proof-of-work
   in the hash they're working on. If anyone was working on a different
   attack
   time, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now
   longer.
   After two hours, one attack time should be hashed by a chain of 12
   proofs-of-work. Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the
   proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour
   was
   expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the
   computers
   to produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time. They had to
   all have
   seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it. If
   the CPU
   power exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the
   password,
   they can safely attack at the agreed time.
   The proof-of-work chain is how all the synchronisation, distributed
   database
   and global view problems you've asked about are solved.

   Fortunately, it's only necessary to keep a pending-transaction pool for
   the
   current best branch. When a new block arrives for the best branch,
   ConnectBlock removes the block's transactions from the pending-tx pool.
   If a
   different branch becomes longer, it calls DisconnectBlock on the main
   branch
   down to the fork, returning the block transactions to the pending-tx
   pool, and
   calls ConnectBlock on the new branch, sopping back up any transactions
   that
   were in both branches. It's expected that reorgs like this would be
   rare and
   shallow.
   With this optimisation, candidate branches are not really any burden.
   They
   just sit on the disk and don't require attention unless they ever
   become the
   main chain.

   Broadcasts will probably be almost completely reliable. TCP
   transmissions are
   rarely ever dropped these days, and the broadcast protocol has a retry
   mechanism to get the data from other nodes after a while. If broadcasts
   turn
   out to be slower in practice than expected, the target time between
   blocks may
   have to be increased to avoid wasting resources. We want blocks to
   usually
   propagate in much less time than it takes to generate them, otherwise
   nodes
   would spend too much time working on obsolete blocks.
   I'm planning to run an automated test with computers randomly sending
   payments
   to each other and randomly dropping packets.

   It's very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it

   No challenges or secret shares. A basic transaction is just what you
   see in
   the figure in section 2. A signature (of the buyer) satisfying the
   public key
   of the previous transaction, and a new public key (of the seller) that
   must be
   satisfied to spend it the next time.

   Right, if it's equal in length, ties are broken by keeping the earliest
   one
   received.

   There's no need for reporting of "proof of double spending" like that.
   If the
   same chain contains both spends, then the block is invalid and
   rejected.
   Same if a block didn't have enough proof-of-work. That block is invalid
   and
   rejected. There's no need to circulate a report about it. Every node
   could
   see that and reject it before relaying it.
   If there are two competing chains, each containing a different version
   of the
   same transaction, with one trying to give money to one person and the
   other
   trying to give the same money to someone else, resolving which of the
   spends is
   valid is what the whole proof-of-work chain is about.
   We're not "on the lookout" for double spends to sound the alarm and
   catch the
   cheater. We merely adjudicate which one of the spends is valid.
   Receivers of
   transactions must wait a few blocks to make sure that resolution has
   had time
   to complete. Would be cheaters can try and simultaneously double-spend
   all
   they want, and all they accomplish is that within a few blocks, one of
   the
   spends becomes valid and the others become invalid. Any later
   double-spends
   are immediately rejected once there's already a spend in the main
   chain.
   Even if an earlier spend wasn't in the chain yet, if it was already in
   all the
   nodes' pools, then the second spend would be turned away by all those
   nodes
   that already have the first spend.

   Right. They also refresh whenever a new transaction comes in, so L
   pretty much
   contains everything in A all the time.

   It's a Hashcash style SHA-256 proof-of-work (partial pre-image of
   zero), not a
   signature.

   If you're thinking of it as a CPU-intensive digital signing, then you
   may be
   thinking of a race to finish a long operation first and the fastest
   always
   winning.
   The proof-of-work is a Hashcash style SHA-256 collision finding. It's a
   memoryless process where you do millions of hashes a second, with a
   small
   chance of finding one each time. The 3 or 4 fastest nodes' dominance
   would
   only be proportional to their share of the total CPU power. Anyone's
   chance of
   finding a solution at any time is proportional to their CPU power.
   There will be transaction fees, so nodes will have an incentive to
   receive and
   include all the transactions they can. Nodes will eventually be
   compensated by
   transaction fees alone when the total coins created hits the
   pre-determined
   ceiling.

   Right.

   Every transaction is one of these. Section 9, Combining and Splitting
   Value.

   Right, it's ECC digital signatures. A new key pair is used for every
   transaction.
   It's not pseudonymous in the sense of nyms identifying people, but it
   is at least a little pseudonymous in that the next action on a coin
   can be identified as being from the owner of that coin.

   There is no reliance on identifying anyone. As you've said, it's
   futile and can be trivially defeated with sock puppets.
   The credential that establishes someone as real is the ability to
   supply CPU power.

   Section 11 calculates the worst case under attack. Typically, 5 or
   10 blocks is enough for that. If you're selling something that
   doesn't merit a network-scale attack to steal it, in practice you
   could cut it closer.

   This is a version 2 problem that I believe can be solved fairly
   satisfactorily for most applications.
   The race is to spread your transaction on the network first. Think 6
   degrees of freedom -- it spreads exponentially. It would only take
   something like 2 minutes for a transaction to spread widely enough
   that a competitor starting late would have little chance of grabbing
   very many nodes before the first one is overtaking the whole network.
   During those 2 minutes, the merchant's nodes can be watching for a
   double-spent transaction. The double-spender would not be able to
   blast his alternate transaction out to the world without the merchant
   getting it, so he has to wait before starting.
   If the real transaction reaches 90% and the double-spent tx reaches
   10%, the double-spender only gets a 10% chance of not paying, and 90%
   chance his money gets spent. For almost any type of goods, that's
   not going to be worth it for the scammer.
   Information based goods like access to website or downloads are
   non-fencible. Nobody is going to be able to make a living off
   stealing access to websites or downloads. They can go to the file
   sharing networks to steal that. Most instant-access products aren't
   going to have a huge incentive to steal.
   If a merchant actually has a problem with theft, they can make the
   customer wait 2 minutes, or wait for something in e-mail, which many
   already do. If they really want to optimize, and it's a large
   download, they could cancel the download in the middle if the
   transaction comes back double-spent. If it's website access,
   typically it wouldn't be a big deal to let the customer have access
   for 5 minutes and then cut off access if it's rejected. Many such
   sites have a free trial anyway.

   I mean a node only needs the pending-tx pool for the best branch it
   has. The branch that it currently thinks is the best branch.
   That's the branch it'll be trying to make a block out of, which is
   all it needs the pool for.

   I think I've got the peer networking broadcast mechanism covered.
   Each node sends its neighbours an inventory list of hashes of the
   new blocks and transactions it has. The neighbours request the
   items they don't have yet. If the item never comes through after a
   timeout, they request it from another neighbour that had it. Since
   all or most of the neighbours should eventually have each item,
   even if the coms get fumbled up with one, they can get it from any
   of the others, trying one at a time.
   The inventory-request-data scheme introduces a little latency, but
   it ultimately helps speed more by keeping extra data blocks off the
   transmit queues and conserving bandwidth.

   I believe I've worked through all those little details over the
   last year and a half while coding it, and there were a lot of them.
   The functional details are not covered in the paper, but the
   sourcecode is coming soon. I sent you the main files.
   (available by request at the moment, full release soon)

Bitcoin v0.1 released 2009-01-10 01:05:49 UTC

   Announcing the first release of Bitcoin, a new electronic cash
   system that uses a peer-to-peer network to prevent double-spending.
   It's completely decentralized with no server or central authority.
   See bitcoin.org for screenshots.
   Download link:
   http://downloads.sourceforge.net/bitcoin/bitcoin-0.1.0.rar
   Windows only for now. Open source C++ code is included.
   - Unpack the files into a directory
   - Run BITCOIN.EXE
   - It automatically connects to other nodes
   If you can keep a node running that accepts incoming connections,
   you'll really be helping the network a lot. Port 8333 on your
   firewall needs to be open to receive incoming connections.
   The software is still alpha and experimental. There's no guarantee
   the system's state won't have to be restarted at some point if it
   becomes necessary, although I've done everything I can to build in
   extensibility and versioning.
   You can get coins by getting someone to send you some, or turn on
   Options->Generate Coins to run a node and generate blocks. I made
   the proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so
   for a little while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to
   generate coins in just a few hours. It'll get a lot harder when
   competition makes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty.
   Generated coins must wait 120 blocks to mature before they can be
   spent.
   There are two ways to send money. If the recipient is online, you
   can enter their IP address and it will connect, get a new public
   key and send the transaction with comments. If the recipient is
   not online, it is possible to send to their Bitcoin address, which
   is a hash of their public key that they give you. They'll receive
   the transaction the next time they connect and get the block it's
   in. This method has the disadvantage that no comment information
   is sent, and a bit of privacy may be lost if the address is used
   multiple times, but it is a useful alternative if both users can't
   be online at the same time or the recipient can't receive incoming
   connections.
   Total circulation will be 21,000,000 coins. It'll be distributed
   to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half
   every 4 years.
   first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins
   next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins
   next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins
   next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins
   etc...
   When that runs out, the system can support transaction fees if
   needed. It's based on open market competition, and there will
   probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free.

[bitcoin-list] Bitcoin v0.1.2 now available 2009-01-11 22:32:18 UTC

   Bitcoin v0.1.2 is now available for download.
   See http://www.bitcoin.org for the download link.
   All the problems I've been finding are in the code that
   automatically finds and connects to other nodes, since I wasn't
   able to test it in the wild until now. There are many more ways
   for connections to get screwed up on the real Internet.
   Bugs fixed:
   - Fixed various problems that were making it hard for new nodes to
   see other nodes to connect to.
   - If you're behind a firewall, it could only receive one
   connection, and the second connection would constantly disconnect
   and reconnect.
   These problems are kind of screwing up the network and will get
   worse as more users arrive, so please make sure to upgrade.

[bitcoin-list] Bitcoin v0.1 Alpha release notes 2009-01-12 20:20:47 UTC

   Release notes for Bitcoin v0.1 Alpha
   Bitcoin is a new electronic cash system that uses a peer-to-peer
   network to prevent double-spending. It's completely decentralized
   with no server or central authority.
   You can find screenshots and the download link at:
   http://www.bitcoin.org
   Windows only for now. Open source C++ code is included.
   - Unpack the files into a directory
   - Run BITCOIN.EXE
   - It automatically connects to other nodes
   If you can keep a node running that accepts incoming connections,
   you'll really be helping the network a lot. Port 8333 on your
   firewall needs to be open to receive incoming connections.
   The software is still alpha and experimental. There's no guarantee
   the system's state won't have to be restarted at some point if it
   becomes necessary, although I've done everything I can to build in
   extensibility and versioning.
   You can get coins by getting someone to send you some, or turn on
   Options->Generate Coins to run a node and generate blocks. I made
   the proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so
   for a little while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to
   generate coins in just a few hours. It'll get a lot harder when
   competition makes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty.
   Generated coins must wait 120 blocks to mature before they can be
   spent.
   There are two ways to send money. If the recipient is online, you
   can enter their IP address and it will connect, get a new public
   key and send the transaction with comments. If the recipient is
   not online, it is possible to send to their Bitcoin address, which
   is a hash of their public key that they give you. They'll receive
   the transaction the next time they connect and get the block it's
   in. This method has the disadvantage that no comment information
   is sent, and a bit of privacy may be lost if the address is used
   multiple times, but it is a useful alternative if both users can't
   be online at the same time or the recipient can't receive incoming
   connections.
   Total circulation will be 21,000,000 coins. It'll be distributed
   to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half
   every 4 years.
   first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins
   next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins
   next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins
   next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins
   etc...
   When that runs out, the system can support transaction fees if
   needed. It's based on open market competition, and there will
   probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free.

[bitcoin-list] Bitcoin v0.1.3 2009-01-12 22:48:23 UTC

   It looks like we're through with the worst of the Internet
   connection issues. 0.1.3 fixed a problem where your node's
   communications could go dead after a while. The network is
   running much more smoothly now with this version.
   If you've successfully generated a block, you've seen it has a
   maturation countdown before you can spend it. Once it matures,
   the Credit column will change from 0.00 to 50.00. For a block to
   be valid, it has to be broadcasted to the network and get into the
   block chain, which is why Generate does not run if you're not
   connected. If you generated a block without being connected, the
   network wouldn't know about it and would continue building the
   chain without it, leaving it behind, and the maturation countdown
   would change to "(not accepted)" when your node sees that it
   wasn't used. If you subtract 1 from the status column, that's how
   many blocks have been chained after yours.

   I would be surprised if 10 years from now we're not using
   electronic currency in some way, now that we know a way to do it
   that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the trusted third party
   gets cold feet.
   It could get started in a narrow niche like reward points,
   donation tokens, currency for a game or micropayments for adult
   sites. Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications
   for services that could almost be free but not quite.
   It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail. The send dialog is
   resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.
   It's sent directly when it connects. The recipient doubleclicks
   on the transaction to see the full message. If someone famous is
   getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to
   have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and
   give out the IP address on their website. "Send X bitcoins to my
   priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally."
   Subscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their
   free trial so it doesn't cannibalize subscriptions could charge
   bitcoins for the trial.
   It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If
   enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling
   prophecy. Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many
   applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a
   website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine.

   Another factor that would mitigate spam if POW tokens have value:
   there would be a profit motive for people to set up massive
   quantities of fake e-mail accounts to harvest POW tokens from
   spam. They'd essentially be reverse-spamming the spammers with
   automated mailboxes that collect their POW and don't read the
   message. The ratio of fake mailboxes to real people could become
   too high for spam to be cost effective.
   The process has the potential to establish the POW token's value
   in the first place, since spammers that don't have a botnet could
   buy tokens from harvesters. While the buying back would
   temporarily let more spam through, it would only hasten the
   self-defeating cycle leading to too many harvesters exploiting the
   spammers.
   Interestingly, one of the e-gold systems already has a form of
   spam called "dusting". Spammers send a tiny amount of gold dust
   in order to put a spam message in the transaction's comment field.
   If the system let users configure the minimum payment they're
   willing to receive, or at least the minimum that can have a
   message with it, users could set how much they're willing to get
   paid to receive spam.

   If you send me your debug.log file directly (best not to send

Re: [bitcoin-list] Bitcoin v0.1.5 released 2009-02-22 17:47:52 UTC

   > What's next?
   The next thing for v0.1.6 is to take advantage of multiple
   processors to generate blocks. Currently it only starts one
   thread. If you have a multi-core processor like a Core Duo or
   Quad this will double or quadruple your production.
   Later I want to add interfaces to make it really easy to integrate
   into websites from any server side language.

   The current version will work fine. They'll each connect over the
   Internet, while incoming connections only come to the host that
   port 8333 is routed to.
   As an optimisation, I'll make a switch "-connect=1.2.3.4" to make
   it only connect to a specific address. You could make your extra
   nodes connect to your primary, and only the primary connects over
   the Internet. It doesn't really matter for now, since the network
   would have to get huge before the bandwidth is anything more than
   trivial.

   Indeed, Bitcoin is a distributed secure timestamp server for
   transactions. A few lines of code could create a transaction with
   an extra hash in it of anything that needs to be timestamped.
   I should add a command to timestamp a file that way.

   I haven't had any reports of crashes in v0.1.5. It's been rock solid
   for me on Windows. I think it must be Wine related. If you get another
   crash in Wine and it prints anything on the terminal, e-mail me and I
   may be able to figure out what happened, maybe something I can work
   around. Martti and I have been working on a new version to release soon
   and it would be nice to get any Wine fixes in there.

   Those don't look like anything to worry about. Probably functions
   unimplemented by Wine that are harmlessly stubbed out.

   You can delete debug.log occasionally if you don't want to take the
   disk
   space. It's just status messages that help with debugging.
   bitcoin.sourceforge.net looks fine now. Maybe sourceforge was doing
   some maintenance.

[bitcoin-list] Bitcoin 0.3 released! 2010-07-06 21:53:53 UTC

   Announcing version 0.3 of Bitcoin, the P2P cryptocurrency! Bitcoin is a
   digital currency using cryptography and a distributed network to
   replace
   the need for a trusted central server. Escape the arbitrary inflation
   risk of centrally managed currencies! Bitcoin's total circulation is
   limited to 21 million coins. The coins are gradually released to the
   network's nodes based on the CPU power they contribute, so you can get
   a
   share of them by contributing your idle CPU time.
   What's new:
   - Command line and JSON-RPC control
   - Includes a daemon version without GUI
   - Transaction filter tabs
   - 20% faster hashing
   - Hashmeter performance display
   - Mac OS X version (thanks to Laszlo)
   - German, Dutch and Italian translations (thanks to DataWraith, Xunie
   and Joozero)
   Get it at http://www.bitcoin.org, and read the forum to find out more.
