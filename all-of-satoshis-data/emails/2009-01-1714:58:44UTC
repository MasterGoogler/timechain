   I would be surprised if 10 years from now we're not using
   electronic currency in some way, now that we know a way to do it
   that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the trusted third party
   gets cold feet.
   It could get started in a narrow niche like reward points,
   donation tokens, currency for a game or micropayments for adult
   sites. Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications
   for services that could almost be free but not quite.
   It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail. The send dialog is
   resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.
   It's sent directly when it connects. The recipient doubleclicks
   on the transaction to see the full message. If someone famous is
   getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to
   have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and
   give out the IP address on their website. "Send X bitcoins to my
   priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally."
   Subscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their
   free trial so it doesn't cannibalize subscriptions could charge
   bitcoins for the trial.
   It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If
   enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling
   prophecy. Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many
   applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a
   website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine.
