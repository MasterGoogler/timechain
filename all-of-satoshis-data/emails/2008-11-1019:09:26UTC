   If you're having trouble with the inflation issue, it's easy to tweak
   it for
   transaction fees instead. It's as simple as this: let the output value
   from
   any transaction be 1 cent less than the input value. Either the client
   software automatically writes transactions for 1 cent more than the
   intended
   payment value, or it could come out of the payee's side. The incentive
   value
   when a node finds a proof-of-work for a block could be the total of the
   fees in
   the block.
