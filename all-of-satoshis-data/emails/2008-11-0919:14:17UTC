   The proof-of-work chain is the solution to the synchronisation problem,
   and to
   knowing what the globally shared view is without having to trust
   anyone.
   A transaction will quickly propagate throughout the network, so if two
   versions
   of the same transaction were reported at close to the same time, the
   one with
   the head start would have a big advantage in reaching many more nodes
   first.
   Nodes will only accept the first one they see, refusing the second one
   to
   arrive, so the earlier transaction would have many more nodes working
   on
   incorporating it into the next proof-of-work. In effect, each node
   votes for
   its viewpoint of which transaction it saw first by including it in its
   proof-of-work effort.
   If the transactions did come at exactly the same time and there was an
   even
   split, it's a toss up based on which gets into a proof-of-work first,
   and that
   decides which is valid.
   When a node finds a proof-of-work, the new block is propagated
   throughout the
   network and everyone adds it to the chain and starts working on the
   next block
   after it. Any nodes that had the other transaction will stop trying to
   include
   it in a block, since it's now invalid according to the accepted chain.
   The proof-of-work chain is itself self-evident proof that it came from
   the
   globally shared view. Only the majority of the network together has
   enough CPU
   power to generate such a difficult chain of proof-of-work. Any user,
   upon
   receiving the proof-of-work chain, can see what the majority of the
   network has
   approved. Once a transaction is hashed into a link that's a few links
   back in
   the chain, it is firmly etched into the global history.
