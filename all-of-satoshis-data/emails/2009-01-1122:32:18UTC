[bitcoin-list] Bitcoin v0.1.2 now available 2009-01-11 22:32:18 UTC

   Bitcoin v0.1.2 is now available for download.
   See http://www.bitcoin.org for the download link.
   All the problems I've been finding are in the code that
   automatically finds and connects to other nodes, since I wasn't
   able to test it in the wild until now. There are many more ways
   for connections to get screwed up on the real Internet.
   Bugs fixed:
   - Fixed various problems that were making it hard for new nodes to
   see other nodes to connect to.
   - If you're behind a firewall, it could only receive one
   connection, and the second connection would constantly disconnect
   and reconnect.
   These problems are kind of screwing up the network and will get
   worse as more users arrive, so please make sure to upgrade.
