   Thanks for bringing up that point.
   I didn't really make that statement as strong as I could have. The
   requirement
   is that the good guys collectively have more CPU power than any single
   attacker.
   There would be many smaller zombie farms that are not big enough to
   overpower
   the network, and they could still make money by generating bitcoins.
   The
   smaller farms are then the "honest nodes". (I need a better term than
   "honest") The more smaller farms resort to generating bitcoins, the
   higher the
   bar gets to overpower the network, making larger farms also too small
   to
   overpower it so that they may as well generate bitcoins too. According
   to the
   "long tail" theory, the small, medium and merely large farms put
   together
   should add up to a lot more than the biggest zombie farm.
   Even if a bad guy does overpower the network, it's not like he's
   instantly
   rich. All he can accomplish is to take back money he himself spent,
   like
   bouncing a check. To exploit it, he would have to buy something from a
   merchant, wait till it ships, then overpower the network and try to
   take his
   money back. I don't think he could make as much money trying to pull a
   carding
   scheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins. With a zombie farm
   that
   big, he could generate more bitcoins than everyone else combined.
   The Bitcoin network might actually reduce spam by diverting zombie
   farms to
   generating bitcoins instead.
