   The proof-of-work chain is a solution to the Byzantine Generals'
   Problem. I'll
   try to rephrase it in that context.
   A number of Byzantine Generals each have a computer and want to attack
   the
   King's wi-fi by brute forcing the password, which they've learned is a
   certain
   number of characters in length. Once they stimulate the network to
   generate a
   packet, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in
   and
   erase the logs, otherwise they will be discovered and get in trouble.
   They
   only have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of
   them attack
   at the same time.
   They don't particularly care when the attack will be, just that they
   all agree.
   It has been decided that anyone who feels like it will announce a time,
   and
   whatever time is heard first will be the official attack time. The
   problem is
   that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce
   different
   attack times at close to the same time, some may hear one first and
   others hear
   the other first.
   They use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem. Once each general
   receives whatever attack time he hears first, he sets his computer to
   solve an
   extremely difficult proof-of-work problem that includes the attack time
   in its
   hash. The proof-of-work is so difficult, it's expected to take 10
   minutes of
   them all working at once before one of them finds a solution. Once one
   of the
   generals finds a proof-of-work, he broadcasts it to the network, and
   everyone
   changes their current proof-of-work computation to include that
   proof-of-work
   in the hash they're working on. If anyone was working on a different
   attack
   time, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now
   longer.
   After two hours, one attack time should be hashed by a chain of 12
   proofs-of-work. Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the
   proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour
   was
   expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the
   computers
   to produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time. They had to
   all have
   seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it. If
   the CPU
   power exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the
   password,
   they can safely attack at the agreed time.
   The proof-of-work chain is how all the synchronisation, distributed
   database
   and global view problems you've asked about are solved.
