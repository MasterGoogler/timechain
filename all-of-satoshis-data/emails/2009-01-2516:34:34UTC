   Another factor that would mitigate spam if POW tokens have value:
   there would be a profit motive for people to set up massive
   quantities of fake e-mail accounts to harvest POW tokens from
   spam. They'd essentially be reverse-spamming the spammers with
   automated mailboxes that collect their POW and don't read the
   message. The ratio of fake mailboxes to real people could become
   too high for spam to be cost effective.
   The process has the potential to establish the POW token's value
   in the first place, since spammers that don't have a botnet could
   buy tokens from harvesters. While the buying back would
   temporarily let more spam through, it would only hasten the
   self-defeating cycle leading to too many harvesters exploiting the
   spammers.
   Interestingly, one of the e-gold systems already has a form of
   spam called "dusting". Spammers send a tiny amount of gold dust
   in order to put a spam message in the transaction's comment field.
   If the system let users configure the minimum payment they're
   willing to receive, or at least the minimum that can have a
   message with it, users could set how much they're willing to get
   paid to receive spam.
