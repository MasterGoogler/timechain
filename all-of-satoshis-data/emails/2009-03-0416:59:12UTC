   The current version will work fine. They'll each connect over the
   Internet, while incoming connections only come to the host that
   port 8333 is routed to.
   As an optimisation, I'll make a switch "-connect=1.2.3.4" to make
   it only connect to a specific address. You could make your extra
   nodes connect to your primary, and only the primary connects over
   the Internet. It doesn't really matter for now, since the network
   would have to get huge before the bandwidth is anything more than
   trivial.

   Indeed, Bitcoin is a distributed secure timestamp server for
   transactions. A few lines of code could create a transaction with
   an extra hash in it of anything that needs to be timestamped.
   I should add a command to timestamp a file that way.

   Exactly.
