Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper 2008-11-01 23:16:33 UTC

   I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully
   peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.
   The paper is available at:
   http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
   The main properties:
   Double-spending is prevented with a peer-to-peer network.
   No mint or other trusted parties.
   Participants can be anonymous.
   New coins are made from Hashcash style proof-of-work.
   The proof-of-work for new coin generation also powers the
   network to prevent double-spending.
   Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
   Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would
   allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another
   without the burdens of going through a financial institution.
   Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
   benefits are lost if a trusted party is still required to prevent
   double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending
   problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps
   transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based
   proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without
   redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as
   proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came
   from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as honest nodes control
   the most CPU power on the network, they can generate the longest
   chain and outpace any attackers. The network itself requires
   minimal structure. Messages are broadcasted on a best effort basis,
   and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the
   longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they
   were gone.
