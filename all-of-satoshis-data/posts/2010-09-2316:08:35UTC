   The current threshold is 200KB per block, or about 1000 transactions
   per block.  I think it should be lowered to 50KB per block.  That would
   still be more than 100 times the average transactions per block.
   I implemented this change in SVN rev 157.
   The reason I previously made it so high was to allow very large
   transactions without hitting the transaction fee.  The threshold was
   around 26,000 BTC for transactions made of 50 BTC generated coins.
   Even though it was 100 times easier to generate back then, only a few
   people ever encountered the fee at that level.  The new threshold puts
   it at around 11,000 BTC for sending generated coins.  It would mostly
   only be reached with generated bitcoins.  If you bought your bitcoins,
   theyʼll be denominated in larger transactions and wonʼt be anywhere
   near the fee limit, unless you bought them in several hundred separate
   transactions.  Even if you do reach the fee level, you only have to pay
   it once to bundle your little transactions together.
