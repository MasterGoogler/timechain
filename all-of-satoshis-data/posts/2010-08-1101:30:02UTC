   Ask some real-world business owners if they want to tell their
   customers about the chance of the money being lost forever,
   unrecoverable by either party.
   That makes it sound like it might somehow get lost and the parties
   canʼt get it even if they want to cooperate.
   When you pay for something up front, you canʼt get it back either.
   Consumers seem comfortable with that.  Itʼs no worse than that.
   Either party always has the option to release it to the other.

   But the money burning solution, while great at preventing economically
   viable fraud, does nothing to prevent revenge and actually makes
   everyone loose if one side is dishonest. I would certainly not endorse
   that.
   Then you must also be against the common system of payment up front,
   where the customer loses.
   Payment up front: customer loses, and the thief gets the money.
   Simple escrow: customer loses, but the thief doesnʼt get the money
   either.
   Are you guys saying payment up front is better, because at least the
   thief gets the money, so at least someone gets it?
   Imagine someone stole something from you.  You canʼt get it back, but
   if you could, if it had a kill switch that could be remote triggered,
   would you do it?  Would it be a good thing for thieves to know that
   everything you own has a kill switch and if they steal it, itʼll be
   useless to them, although you still lose it too?  If they give it back,
   you can re-activate it.
   Imagine if gold turned to lead when stolen.  If the thief gives it
   back, it turns to gold again.
   It still seems to me the problem may be one of presenting it the right
   way.  For one thing, not being so blunt about "money burning" for the
   purposes of game theory discussion.  The money is never truly burned.
   You have the option to release it at any time forever.
