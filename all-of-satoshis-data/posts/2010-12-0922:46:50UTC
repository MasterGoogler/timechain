   seems that the miner would have to basically do "extra work". and if
   thereʼs no reward from the bitdns mining from the extra work (which of
   course, slows down the main bitcoin work), what would be a minerʼs
   incentive to include bitdns (and whatever other side chains) ?
   The incentive is to get the rewards from the extra side chains also for
   the same work.
   While you are generating bitcoins, why not also get free domain names
   for the same work?
   If you currently generate 50 BTC per week, now you could get 50 BTC and
   some domain names too.
   You have one piece of work.  If you solve it, it will solve a block
   from both Bitcoin and BitDNS.  In concept, theyʼre tied together by a
   Merkle Tree.  To hand it in to Bitcoin, you break off the BitDNS
   branch, and to hand it in to BitDNS, you break off the Bitcoin branch.
   In practice, to retrofit it for Bitcoin, the BitDNS side would have to
   have maybe ~200 extra bytes, but thatʼs not a big deal.  Youʼve been
   talking about 50 domains per block, which would dwarf that little 200
   bytes per block for backward compatibility.  We could potentially
   schedule a far in future block when Bitcoin would upgrade to a
   modernised arrangement with the Merkle Tree on top, if we care enough
   about saving a few bytes.
   Note that the chains are below this new Merkle Tree.  That is, each of
   Bitcoin and BitDNS have their own chain links inside their blocks.
   This is inverted from the common timestamp server arrangement, where
   the chain is on top and then the Merkle Tree, because that creates one
   common master chain.  This is two timestamp servers not sharing a
   chain.
