Re: overflow bug SERIOUS

2010-08-16 22:54:55 UTC - [11]Original Post

   Un-upgraded nodes have the correct chain most of the time, but they are
   still trying to include the overflow transaction in every block, so
   theyʼre continually trying to fork and generate invalid blocks.  If an
   old version node is restarted, its transaction pool is emptied, so it
   may generate valid blocks for a while until the transaction gets
   broadcast again.  0.3.9 and lower nodes still must upgrade.
   The SVN now has the code we needed to automatically reorg the block
   chain without having to delete the blk*.dat files manually.  I knew I
   couldnʼt write that code fast and carefully enough yesterday, so I went
   with the quick manual option.
