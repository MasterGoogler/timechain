Re: Memory leak

   Youʼre connecting to yourself.  All 21 connection attempts were to a
   node with version 31300 (0.3.13).  Not everyone has 0.3.13 yet.
   IRC seems to be working.  It ought to have other nodes to try.
   There may be something I need to do to make sure it doesnʼt try to
   connect to itself again right away after disconnecting.  I canʼt see
   how itʼs happening though, it should be resetting nLastTry which would
   put it to the back of the queue, but the log doesnʼt show it.
   You can try moving addr.dat aside.  Maybe thereʼs something wrong in
   it.
   Are you using -addnode?
