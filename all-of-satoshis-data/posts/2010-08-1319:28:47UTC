Re: Not a suggestion

   Iʼm not grasping your idea yet.  Does it hide any information from the
   public network?  What is the advantage?
   If at least 50% of nodes validated transactions enough that old
   transactions can be discarded, then everyone saw everything and could
   keep a record of it.
   Can public nodes see the values of transactions?  Can they see which
   previous transaction the value came from?  If they can, then they know
   everything.  If they canʼt, then they couldnʼt verify that the value
   came from a valid source, so you couldnʼt take their generated chain as
   verification of it.
   Does it hide the bitcoin addresses?  Is that it?  OK, maybe now I see,
   if thatʼs it.
   Crypto may offer a way to do "key blinding".  I did some research and
   it was obscure, but there may be something there.  "group signatures"
   may be related.
   Thereʼs something here in the general area:
   [12]http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/hopwood/crypto/rh/
   What we need is a way to generate additional blinded variations of a
   public key.  The blinded variations would have the same properties as
   the root public key, such that the private key could generate a
   signature for any one of them.  Others could not tell if a blinded key
   is related to the root key, or other blinded keys from the same root
   key.  These are the properties of blinding.  Blinding, in a nutshell,
   is x = (x * large_random_int) mod m.
   When paying to a bitcoin address, you would generate a new blinded key
   for each use.
   Then you need to be able to sign a signature such that you canʼt tell
   that two signatures came from the same private key.  Iʼm not sure if
   always signing a different blinded public key would already give you
   this property.  If not, I think thatʼs where group signatures comes
   in.  With group signatures, it is possible for something to be signed
   but not know who signed it.
   As an example, say some unpopular military attack has to be ordered,
   but nobody wants to go down in history as the one who ordered it.  If
   10 leaders have private keys, one of them could sign the order and you
   wouldnʼt know who did it.
