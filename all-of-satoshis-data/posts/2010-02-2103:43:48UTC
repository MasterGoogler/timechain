Re: Number of connections

Bitcointalk

   Nodes stop trying to initiate connections once they have 15.  If you
   can accept incoming connections, then you can get well above that from
   nodes connecting to you, otherwise you max out at 15.
   I donʼt know if thereʼs any reason to have 15 connections.  Maybe it
   should be 10.
   Since nodes that can only connect out are probably at or near 15 most
   of the time now, you should level off to an equilibrium.  45 suggests a
   ratio of 3 out-only nodes to every 1 in-accepting node.
   The number of connections wonʼt be a good gauge of the size of the
   network any more.  Someone should periodically IRC to the bitcoin
   channel on chat.freenode.net and count the number of users.  That gives
   you the total count of network nodes (except TOR nodes).
   Block generation is again running ahead of pace.  Weʼre in for another
   big step up in difficulty at the next adjustment in about 5 days.
