Re: Hostnames instead of IP Addresses

Bitcointalk

2010-06-14 19:53:44 UTC - [11]Original Post

   SirArthur has a good point about the normal online merchant case, which
   is what the send-by-IP option is more suited to.  This is the case
   where the merchant will have a server on a static IP and their own
   domain name and SSL cert.
   Instead of connecting by IP, we can connect to a domain name by SSL,
   using the existing CA infrastructure to authenticate that youʼre
   connected to the owner of that domain.
   The user would send to domain.com (or [12]www.domain.com is ok too).
   That would be very natural and users could see and verify that what
   they entered is who they intend to pay.
   The SSL also makes it safe for TOR users.
   Problem is, I think merchants would still prefer to use bitcoin
   addresses to be certain they know what the payment is for.  You simply
   cannot count on users to enter the right thing in the comment fields to
   identify the transaction.  It would only approach practical if we had a
   mailto style link that prepopulates the comment field with the order
   number, but then the link could just as well be a bitcoin address.
   Just having an open bitcoin server at domain.com that users could send
   unidentified payments to would be too much of a liability.  Regular
   users arenʼt used to the idea of having to identify the payment.
   Merchants would get too many blank payments followed by "I paid you,
   whereʼs my stuff?!" a week later.
   The payment sequence does have a step where the receiver verifies the
   order before accepting it.  It can reject the payment and return an
   error message if it doesnʼt contain a valid order number.  That would
   require a difficult level of integration of custom code with the
   bitcoin server though.
