Re: JSON-RPC password

Bitcointalk

   So you drop a settings file in the ~/.bitcoin directory, that sounds
   better.  In the "no password is set" warning, it could tell you where
   the file is and what to do.
   What is the most popular and common settings file format?
   HTTP basic authentication should be considered.  In actual practice
   though, itʼs more work for web developers to figure out how to specify
   the password through some extra parameter in the HTTP or JSON-RPC
   wrapper than to just stick an extra parameter at the beginning of the
   parameter list.  What do you think?  Does HTTP basic authentication get
   us any additional benefits?  Moving it off the parameter list but then
   you still have to specific it in a more esoteric place Iʼm not sure is
   a net win.

   I was confused for a bit because the password is given LAST on the
   command line, but FIRST in the JSON-RPC params list.  I agree that
   reading the command-line password from a file would be more convenient
   and more secure.
   Youʼre also confusing me, what do you mean?  Did I do something
   unintended?
