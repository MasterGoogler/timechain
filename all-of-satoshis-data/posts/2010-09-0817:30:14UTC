Re: Always pay transaction fee?

   Currently, paying a fee is controlled manually with the -paytxfee
   switch.  It would be very easy to make the software automatically check
   the size of recent blocks to see if it should pay a fee.  Weʼre so far
   from reaching the threshold, we donʼt need that yet.  Itʼs a good idea
   to see how things go with controlling it manually first anyway.
   Itʼs not a big deal if we reach the threshold.  Free transactions would
   just take longer to get into a block.
   I did a rough tally of 4000 blocks from around 74000-78000.  This is
   excluding the block reward transactions:
   There were average 2 transactions per block, 17 transactions per hour,
   400 transactions per day.
   Average transaction bytes per block was 428 bytes, or 214 bytes per
   transaction.
   The current threshold is 200KB per block, or about 1000 transactions
   per block.  I think it should be lowered to 50KB per block.  That would
   still be more than 100 times the average transactions per block.
   The threshold can easily be changed in the future.  We can decide to
   increase it when the time comes.  Itʼs a good idea to keep it lower as
   a circuit breaker and increase it as needed.  If we hit the threshold
   now, it would almost certainly be some kind of flood and not actual
   use.  Keeping the threshold lower would help limit the amount of wasted
   disk space in that event.
