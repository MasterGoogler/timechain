Re: Issues building bitcoin on Windows 7

   The lines itʼs tripping on:
   Code:
   ERROR extern map<string, string> mapAddressBook;
   ERROR extern CCriticalSection cs_mapAddressBook;
   ERROR extern vector<unsigned char> vchDefaultKey;
   OK extern bool fClient;
   OK extern int nBestHeight;
   OK extern unsigned int nWalletDBUpdated;
   ERROR extern DbEnv dbenv;
   So itʼs acting like nothing is defined, not even map and vector.
   Yet, db.h is included by headers.h (and only there, nowhere else) which
   includes vector, map, util.h and everything before db.h.
   Is VC trying to use precompiled headers and screwing it up?  Could
   there be some leftover precompiled header files in your directory from
   previously failed attempts that itʼs finding and using?
   Thereʼs an installer package now that makes it really easy to install
   MinGW.  Donʼt use the latest version 4.5.0, use a few versions back
   like 4.4.1 (1.908.0) or 1.812.0.  A setup program completely installs
   everything, itʼs not hard like it used to be.  I think the only thing I
   had to do was rename make*.exe something to make.exe.

   Off topic, but: It would be nice if someone would hack on getting
   tcatmʼs 4-way 128-bit SSE2 code working on Windows.  Thereʼs something
   with MinGWʼs optimisation, Iʼm not sure but maybe a problem with
   16-byte alignment on the stack, that makes it segfault.  With some
   fiddling, I was able to get his code to work in a test program, but not
   in Bitcoin itself for some reason.
