Re: Scalability

   The design outlines a lightweight client that does not need the full
   block chain.  In the design PDF itʼs called Simplified Payment
   Verification.  The lightweight client can send and receive
   transactions, it just canʼt generate blocks.  It does not need to trust
   a node to verify payments, it can still verify them itself.
   The lightweight client is not implemented yet, but the plan is to
   implement it when itʼs needed.  For now, everyone just runs a full
   network node.
   I anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less.
   It will reach an equilibrium where itʼs not worth it for more nodes to
   join in.  The rest will be lightweight clients, which could be
   millions.
   At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two
   network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN.
