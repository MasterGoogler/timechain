Faster initial block download (5x faster)

Bitcointalk

2010-07-23 18:24:56 UTC - [11]Original Post

   By making some adjustments to the database settings, I was able to make
   the initial block download about 5 times faster.  It downloads in about
   30 minutes.
   The database default had it writing each block to disk synchronously,
   which is not necessary.  I changed the settings to let it cache the
   changes in memory and write them out in a batch.  Blocks are still
   written transactionally, so either the complete change occurs or none
   of it does, in either case the data is left in a valid state.
   I only enabled this change during the initial block download.  When you
   come within 2000 blocks of the latest block, these changes turn off and
   it slows down to the old way.
   I built a test build if youʼd like to start using it:

   [13]http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.2.5-linux.tar.gz
   These binaries also include Gavin Andresenʼs JSON-RPC HTTP
   authentication feature and the other important security improvements
   from 0.3.2.
   Iʼve been running a test over the last 24 hours that kills and restarts
   it randomly every 2-60 seconds (poor thing) while itʼs trying to do an
   initial block download and itʼs been fine.
   There are no changes to the way it handles wallet.dat.  This change is
   only for blk*.dat and the non-critical addr.dat.  You can always delete
   blk*.dat if it gets screwed up and let it re-download.
