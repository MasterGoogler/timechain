   I added to the FAQ the warning to back up after each transaction. Is it
   necessary btw to stop the client before making a backup? Thatʼs a bit
   inconvenient. Automatic backups would be useful indeed.
   You can get away with backing up without stopping the client if you
   donʼt do anything or receive a payment within a few seconds before the
   backup.  (like 5 seconds)

   Wait, Iʼm confused again. I thought the essence of the surprise was
   that Bitcoin is programmed to "empty your wallet" for EACH transaction.
   No, it doesnʼt usually empty your wallet with each transaction.  It
   uses the smallest set of coins it can find to add up to near the
   amount.  In this case, unfortunately, his wallet had a single 9000 BTC
   bill in it, and it had to break it to get 1 BTC and 8999 BTC change.
