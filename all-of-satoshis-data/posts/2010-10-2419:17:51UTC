   I have the beginning of something like this.  Itʼs mostly like what
   Gavin described.
   Some more rpc interface:
   move <fromaccount> <toaccount> <amount>
      Move from one internal account to another.  I think blank account
   name ("") will be your default account.  If you sell something to a
   user, you could do move "theiraccount" "" 123.45.
      Is "move" the best name for this?  I shied away from "transfer"
   because that sounds too close to sending a transaction.
   Iʼm thinking a new function getaccountaddress instead of overloading
   getnewaddress:
   getaccountaddress <account>
      Gives you an address allocated from getnewaddress <account>.  Itʼll
   keep giving the same address until something is received on the
   address, then it allocates a new address.  (It automatically does what
   the sample code I posted some time ago did)
   Would these commands make it possible in simple cases to implement your
   website without needing a database of your own?
