Re: [PATCH] implement 'listtransactions'

Bitcointalk

2010-07-30 19:40:54 UTC - [11]Original Post

   What are you needing to use listtransactions for?
   The reason I didnʼt implement listtransactions is I want to make sure
   web programmers donʼt use it.  It would be very easy to latch onto that
   for watching for received payments.  There is no reliable way to do it
   that way and make sure nothing can slip through the cracks.  Until we
   have solid example code using getreceivedbyaddress and
   getreceivedbylabel to point to and say "use this! use this! donʼt use
   listtransactions!", I donʼt think we should implement listtransactions.
   When we do implement listtransactions, maybe one way to fight that is
   to make it all text.  It should not break down the fields into e.g.
   comment, confirmations, credit, debit.  It could be one pretty
   formatted string like "0/unconfirmed   0:0:0 date   comment      debit
   4  credit 0" or something so itʼs hard for programmers to do the wrong
   thing and process it.  Itʼs only for viewing the status of your server.
    I guess that would be kinda annoying for web interfaces that would
   rather format it into html columns though.
