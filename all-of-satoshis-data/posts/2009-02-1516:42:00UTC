Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency

   Could be. They're talking about the old Chaumian central mint stuff,
   but maybe only because that was the only thing available. Maybe they
   would be interested in going in a new direction.
   A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause
   because of all the companies that failed since the 1990's. I hope it's
   obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems
   that doomed them. I think this is the first time we're trying a
   decentralized, non-trust-based system.
