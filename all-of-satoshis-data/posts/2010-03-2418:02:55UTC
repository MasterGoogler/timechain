Re: Idea for file hosting and proxy services

   Mihalism Multi Host is a popular open source PHP file hosting server.
   Itʼs geared toward image hosting, but I think by increasing the file
   size limit and liberalising the allowed file extensions, it could just
   as easily be used for general file upload hosting.  They need the
   limits to keep it reasonable as a free service, but if we bolt on a
   Bitcoin payment mechanism, the limits could be relaxed.
   It doesnʼt have a bunch of client side scripting or anti-embedding junk
   to rip out.  It generates standard links that work normally.
   Thereʼs a turnover churn in these free hosting sites.  Small sites can
   give free image hosting, but once one starts getting popular, it gets
   too swamped with moochers using them for free bandwidth.  Any site that
   gets well known has to become more aggressively pay-naggy to cover
   bandwidth costs.  Itʼs a perfect example of a service where the needed
   price point is in the no-manʼs-land between just a little too expensive
   to be free, but too cheap for most users to take the trouble of a
   conventional payment.  Itʼs in the gap between 0 and 19.95.  The best
   they can do is try to maybe get 1 out of 1000 users to pay 9.95, but
   that has 999/1000 users treated like freeloaders.  It canʼt really be
   advertising supported because the images are embedded in other sites
   and downloaded without going to the hosting site.
   An example of a site running the software:

   Forum:
   [13]http://www.mihalism.net/
   Download:

   What do you think?  If I made a Bitcoin payment integration for this,
   would anyone be interested in running it?  It might be the first fully
   automated service available to buy with Bitcoins.  The advantage it
   could offer over the free services is general file upload hosting of
   large files without making downloading users go to the upload site and
   jump through hoops.  It would give a normal link directly to the file.
