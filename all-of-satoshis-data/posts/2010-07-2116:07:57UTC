   I just did a quick survey of 20 .conf files in /etc on my debian
   system, and found:
    1 file used "key value"
    5 used "key=value"
   Thanks for that survey!
   I find "key value" a little unnatural.  There ought to be a more
   definite separator between key and value that suggests assignment.  The
   space people may just be getting lazy using their languageʼs split
   function.
   key=some full sentence with spaces in it.  # seems more clear
   key some full sentence with spaces in it.  # than this
   Allright then, lets go with self-parsed mapConfig, syntax:
   # comment
   key=value
   file extension .conf.  Whatʼs the filename, is it
   ~/.bitcoin/settings.conf or ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf or what?
   I think we better strip whitespace at the beginning and end of the key
   and the value.
   # user who likes column formatted
   k            = value
   key         = value
   longerkey =   this sentence would be this    # "this sentence would be
   this"
           key = value   # guess this is ok too
     nextkey = value
         right = justified
   The normal syntax should be "key=value", but you canʼt blame people for
   the occasional "key = value".
