   The recommended ways to do a payment for an order:
   1) The merchant has a static IP, the customer sends to it with a
   comment.
   2) The merchant creates a new bitcoin address, gives it to the
   customer, the customer sends to that address.  This will be the
   standard way for website software to do it.
   RSA vs ECDSA: itʼs not the size of the executable but the size of the
   data.  I thought it would be impractical if the block chain, bitcoin
   addresses, disk space and bandwidth requirements were all an order of
   magnitude bigger.  Also, even if using RSA for messages, it would still
   make sense to do all the bitcoin network with ECDSA and use RSA in
   parallel for only the message part.  In that case, everything thatʼs
   been implemented up to now would be implemented exactly as it has been.
   We can figure out the best way to do this much later.  It could use a
   separate (maybe existing) e-mail or IM infrastructure to pass messages,
   and instead of RSA, maybe just put a hash of the message in the
   transaction to prove that the transaction is for the order described in
   the message.  The message would have to include a salt so nobody could
   brute force the hash to reveal a short message.
