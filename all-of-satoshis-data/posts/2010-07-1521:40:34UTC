   On Windows, the priority of the Coin Generation is still net for
   normal. If you run BitCoin in Generate Coin mode, then load up
   something to eat up all the CPU (like CPU hog for example:
   [13]http://www.microtask.ca/cpuhog.html) youʼll see that both BitCoin
   and CPU hog share the CPU 50/50 instead of CPU Hog taking all the CPU
   and BitCoin running only on idle/low process. The khash/s is also
   reduced in half, so further evidence that the threads are not running
   in a lower than normal prioirty.
   I was not able to reproduce this.  I have dual-proc, so I ran two
   memory hogs.  Bitcoin got 0% of CPU according to the task manager.  The
   khash/sec meter stayed stuck because it couldnʼt get any CPU to update
   it.
   Do you have dual-proc?  Are you sure you werenʼt running a single
   processor hog?
