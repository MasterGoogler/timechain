Re: Need OP_BLOCKNUMBER to allow "time" limited transactions

Bitcointalk

2010-11-15 18:37:44 UTC - [11]Original Post

   We canʼt safely do OP_BLOCKNUMBER.  In the event of a block chain reorg
   after a segmentation, transactions need to be able to get into the
   chain in a later block.  The OP_BLOCKNUMBER transaction and all its
   dependants would become invalid.  This wouldnʼt be fair to later owners
   of the coins who werenʼt involved in the time limited transaction.
   nTimeLock does the reverse.  Itʼs an open transaction that can be
   replaced with new versions until the deadline.  It canʼt be recorded
   until it locks.  The highest version when the deadline hits gets
   recorded.  It could be used, for example, to write an escrow
   transaction that will automatically permanently lock and go through
   unless it is revoked before the deadline.  The feature isnʼt enabled or
   used yet, but the support is there so it could be implemented later.
