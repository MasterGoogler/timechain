   On Debian testing 32-bit, I get a few build errors, all resembling:
   Code:
   script.cpp:114: error: ‘OP_NOP1’ was not declared in this scope
   I got these when attempting to "make bitcoind" without "make clean" or
   "make" first. It looks like the bitcoind build instructions donʼt
   compile the headers first, but they also donʼt delete the
   headers.h.gch, so the old headers are used if present.
   If anyone else gets this error, the simplest solution is to "make
   clean" and retry the build.
   We donʼt really need pre-compiled header.  It only makes it compile
   slightly faster.  I think Iʼll just get rid of it.  Even still, youʼd
   still need to remember to "make -f makefile.unix clean" or delete
   headers.h.gch one more time to get rid of the leftover file.
   Damn that GLIBC_2.11.  I thought Iʼd been careful not to accept any of
   the updates.
