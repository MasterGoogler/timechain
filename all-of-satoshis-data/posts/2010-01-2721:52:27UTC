Re: Bitcoin crash when sending coins

Bitcointalk

   That is what happens if you copy wallet files around.  If you copy your
   wallet file to a second computer, then they both think the money in the
   wallet is theirs.  If one spends any of it, the other doesnʼt know
   those coins are already spent and would try to spend them again, and
   thatʼs the error you would hit.
   Now that itʼs clear this is a key error message, it ought to be
   something more like "the money appears to be already spent...  this
   could happen if you used a copy of your wallet file on another
   computer."
   You can move or backup your wallet file, but it needs to have only one
   "lineage" and only used in one place at a time.  Any time you transfer
   money out of it, then you must no longer use any previous copies.
   This brings up a good point.  In the case of restoring a backup that
   may be from before you spent some coins, we need to add functionality
   to resync it to discover which coins have already been spent.  This
   would not be hard to do, it just hasnʼt been implemented yet.  Iʼll add
   it to the list.  This would make it mostly repair the situation instead
   of giving that error message.
