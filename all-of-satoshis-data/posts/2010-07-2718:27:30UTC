   I was able to integrate the SHA256 functionality from Crypto++ 5.6.0
   into Bitcoin.  This is the fastest SHA256 yet using the SSE2 assembly
   code.  Since Bitcoin was sending unaligned data to the block hash
   function, I had to change the MOVDQA instruction to MOVDQU.
   I think using the SHA256 functionality from Crypto++ 5.6.0 is the way
   forward right now.
   I added a subset of the Crypto++ 5.6.0 library to the SVN.  I stripped
   it down to just SHA and 11 general dependency files.  There shouldnʼt
   be any other crypto in there other than SHA.
   I aligned the data fields and it worked.  The ASM SHA-256 is about 48%
   faster.  The combined speedup is about 2.5x faster than version 0.3.3.
   I guess itʼs using SSE2.  It automatically sets its build configuration
   at compile time based on the compiler environment.
   It looks like it has some SSE2 detection at runtime, but itʼs hard to
   tell if it actually uses it to fall back if itʼs not available.  I want
   the release builds to have SSE2.  SSE2 has been around since the first
   Pentium 4.  A Pentium 3 or older would be so slow, youʼd be wasting
   your electricity trying to generate on it anyway.
   This is SVN rev 114.
