Re: BitCoin Wikipedia page DELETED!!!

   If you do, I think it should be a very brief, single paragraph article
   like 100 words or less that simply identifies what Bitcoin is.
   I wish rather than deleting the article, they put a length
   restriction.  If something is not famous enough, there could at least
   be a stub article identifying what it is.  I often come across annoying
   red links of things that Wiki ought to at least have heard of.
   The article could be as simple as something like:
   "Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer decentralised /link/electronic
   currency/link/."
   The more standard Wiki thing to do is that we should have a paragraph
   in one of the more general categories that we are an instance of, like
   Electronic Currency or Electronic Cash.  We can probably establish a
   paragraph there.  Again, keep it short.  Just identifying what it is.
