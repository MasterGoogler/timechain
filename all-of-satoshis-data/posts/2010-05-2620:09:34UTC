   An optional parameter to specify the minimum number of blocks after
   that transaction (getallreceived 1 for current behavior, or just
   getallreceived, getallreceived 5 for the paranoid, getallreceived 0 for
   instant confirms)?
   Yeah, that actually is what it is.  getallreceived 0 should do what you
   want.  (now itʼs renamed to listreceivedbyaddress 0)  The default is 1
   confirmation, but I think in reality most digital goods and services
   can be 0 confirmations.  Like you say, if you need more than 0
   confirmations, you could show two numbers, unconfirmed and available
   balance, so they immediately see their transaction went through.
   listreceivedbyaddress [minconf=1] [includeempty=false]
   [minconf] is the minimum number of confirmations before payments are
   included.
   [includeempty] whether to include addresses that havenʼt received any
   payments.
   Returns an array of objects containing:
     "address" : receiving address
     "label" : the label of the receiving address
     "amount" : total amount received by the address
     "confirmations" : number of confirmations of the most recent
   transaction included
   or listreceivedbylabel if youʼre labelling addresses with their
   username.
   So far Iʼve concentrated on functions for web merchants, not so much on
   stuff for remote management of headless coin generators yet.
