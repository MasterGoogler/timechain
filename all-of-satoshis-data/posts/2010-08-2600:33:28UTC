Re: RFC: remove DB_PRIVATE flag

Bitcointalk

2010-08-26 00:33:28 UTC - [11]Original Post

   Can you provide more details about what removing DB_PRIVATE does?
   I canʼt remember if I had a specific reason for DB_PRIVATE, or if I
   just copied the flags from some example code.  Does removing DB_PRIVATE
   make it safe for other processes to open the database simultaneously?
   That may be an improvement, depending what the side effects are.  Does
   it substantially reduce performance by making it have to write out
   every change immediately or do other coordination?  Are there
   additional locking or coordination files then?  What else changes?  You
   could test by timing an initial block download with and without
   DB_PRIVATE, preferably -connect-ing to a local machine so network isnʼt
   a factor.
   Apparently, DB_PRIVATE doesnʼt do what you would hope it would do,
   which is prevent other processes from being able to open the database.
   It still lets them, it just screws up if they do.  Another option, if
   thereʼs a way, would be to make it lock the database files so they
   canʼt be accessed by other processes.
