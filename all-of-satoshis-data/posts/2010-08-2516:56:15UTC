   @mizerydearia, I think the quote button is easier to find then the
   reply one.
   So, theoretical this is a first control system where <some goverment>
   can arrest satoshi and demand
   that he hands over his key (or get it from his computer) and shut down
   the complete network?
   Or is that not possible? How far would <some goverment> get?
   A few rhetorical questions for satoshi:
   Can you resist waterboarding?
   Can you endure electric shock?
   All forms of torture?
   Lastly, are you Jack Bauer by any chance?   Seriously.
   WRT the alert system, who cares?  The most the key can do is
   temporarily disable six json-rpc commands until the site owners either
   add the -disablesafemode switch or upgrade.  All nodes keep running and
   generating, the network stays up.  If Iʼm not available, any script
   kiddie can figure out how to add two characters and make a new version
   that disables the alert system.  It would be a temporary inconvenience
   only.

   This is what makes me think the people objecting donʼt know what
   theyʼre talking about.  It canʼt "shut down the complete network".
