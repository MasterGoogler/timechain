   If I figure out that Public Key 123456 generates Hash ABCD
   and
   Public Key 654321 also generates Hash ABCD
   Iʼm still left without the Private Key.
   But from what you are saying, all I need is Public Key 654321 and I can
   spend coin pretending to be Public Key 123456.
   You would still have to sign it with public key 654321.  You need to
   find a collision using a public key for which you know the private key.
   When you claim a Bitcoin Address transaction, you give your public key
   that matches the hash, then you must sign it with that key.
   Redʼs point is that itʼs easy to quickly generate insecure public keys
   which you could break and find the private key after you find a
   collision.
   He points out that if the public key was required to be a secure one,
   one which must have required significant work to find the prime
   numbers, that would increase the strength above that of the hash
   function alone.  Someone trying to brute force would have to take time
   generating a key for each attempt.
