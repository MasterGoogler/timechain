   Excellent analysis, xc.
   A rational market price for something that is expected to increase in
   value will already reflect the present value of the expected future
   increases.  In your head, you do a probability estimate balancing the
   odds that it keeps increasing.
   In the absence of a market to establish the price, NewLibertyStandardʼs
   estimate based on production cost is a good guess and a helpful service
   (thanks).  The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the
   production cost.  If the price is below cost, then production slows
   down.  If the price is above cost, profit can be made by generating and
   selling more.  At the same time, the increased production would
   increase the difficulty, pushing the cost of generating towards the
   price.
   In later years, when new coin generation is a small percentage of the
   existing supply, market price will dictate the cost of production more
   than the other way around.
   At the moment, generation effort is rapidly increasing, suggesting
   people are estimating the present value to be higher than the current
   cost of production.
