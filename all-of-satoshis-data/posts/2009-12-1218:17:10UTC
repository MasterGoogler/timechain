   I almost have the svn 0.2 compiling on Mac OS X 10.4.11/Intel (I also
   have a PPC970 machine here as well so a PPC build would be possible as
   well). The windowing is native carbon too via wxwidgets! It is FAST!
   Wink I had to create a new makefile (makefile.osx; based on
   makefile.unix of course.. given any thought to using autoconf?) and put
   some ifdefʼs into header.h. I have patches. I will keep toying around.
   I might try it on FreeBSD next.
   Mac support would be nice.  wxWidgets really pays off for cross
   platform.
   Please donʼt try PPC.  PPC is big-endian and Bitcoin is little-endian,
   there would be endless endian bugs making it harder for me to debug the
   network if thereʼs a potentially byte-swapping node out there.  PPC is
   on its way out anyway.
   Considered autoconf.  Autoconf is a necessity for large projects with a
   quagmire makefile, but I think weʼre small enough that itʼs more
   optimal without it.  Iʼd rather keep the makefile simple as long as
   possible.

   I think that breaking bitcoin into two apps is ideal. A wxwidgets front
   end (since it is mostly all there) and a backend that binds to a
   control TCP socket. I have been reading over the source to see how hard
   it would be to break it apart and I think it should be fairly simple.
   Of course an API would have to be developed.
   My head hurts just thinking about that.  Funnelling all the UI backend
   through a TCP connection would make everything twice as hard.  Thereʼs
   too much bandwidth between the UI and the internal data structures in
   order to keep the listview control updated, because of the way the
   listview control works.
   Iʼd rather have command line control, that would get us remote admin
   and batch automation.
