Re: Protocol Buffers for Bitcoin

Bitcointalk

2010-08-02 20:22:08 UTC - [11]Original Post

   The reason I didnʼt use protocol buffers or boost serialization is
   because they looked too complex to make absolutely airtight and
   secure.  Their code is too large to read and be sure that thereʼs no
   way to form an input that would do something unexpected.
   I hate reinventing the wheel and only resorted to writing my own
   serialization routines reluctantly.  The serialization format we have
   is as dead simple and flat as possible.  There is no extra freedom in
   the way the input stream is formed.  At each point, the next field in
   the data structure is expected.  The only choices given are those that
   the receiver is expecting.  There is versioning so upgrades are
   possible.
   CAddress is about the only object with significant reserved space in
   it.  (about 7 bytes for flags and 12 bytes for possible future IPv6
   expansion)
   The larger things we have like blocks and transactions canʼt be
   optimized much more for size.  The bulk of their data is hashes and
   keys and signatures, which are uncompressible.  The serialization
   overhead is very small, usually 1 byte for size fields.
   On Gavinʼs idea about an existing P2P broadcast infrastructure, I doubt
   one exists.  There are few P2P systems that only need broadcast.  There
   are some libraries like Chord that try to provide a distributed hash
   table infrastructure, but thatʼs a huge difficult problem that we donʼt
   need or want.  Those libraries are also much harder to install than
   ourselves.
