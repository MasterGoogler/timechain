Re: JSON-RPC password

   I was researching config file formats, hereʼs a comparison.
   YAML is massive.  Iʼm not sure thereʼs a lightweight easy to build
   library we can integrate into our project.  Seems overkill.
   JSON is tempting and Iʼm inclined to like it, but two main sticking
   points:
   1) No comments!  How can you have a config file where you canʼt comment
   out a line to disable it?
   2) Not very user friendly to have to "quote" all the strings, including
   the keys, and also have to remember the comma at the end of lines.
   {
       "key" : "value",
   }
   I suppose we could easily preprocess JSON reading the config file one
   line at a time, truncate the lines at any # character (and/or "//"?),
   concatenate them into a string and pass it to JSON, so you could go:
   # comment
   "key" : "value",   # still have to remember the comma
   "key2" : "value",   // comment like this or both
   Boost has boost::program_options.
   We could read lines ourselves and feed them into a map<string, string>
   mapConfig.
   while (!eof)
     read line
     if ʼ#ʼ found, truncate line
     split line at first ʼ:ʼ -> key, value
     mapConfig.insert(key, value)
   If we use the syntax:
   # comment
   key : value
   ...and donʼt allow whitespace indenting before the keys, I guess we
   would be a subset of YAML and could switch to YAML someday if we need
   more complexity.
   If we go with self parsed, that doesnʼt mean we canʼt use JSON on
   particular parameter values as needed.  If an option needs a list or
   more structured data, it could always parse its value as json:
   key : ["item1", "item2", "item3"]
   Although it has to be all on one line then.
   I guess Iʼm leaning towards self parsed mapConfig:
   # comment
   key : value
