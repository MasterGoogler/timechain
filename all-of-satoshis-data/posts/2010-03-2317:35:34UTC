Re: Exchange Methods

Bitcointalk

2010-03-23 17:35:34 UTC - [11]Original Post

   LR and Pecunix have many established exchanges to paper currencies by
   various payment methods, and a number of vendors accept them as
   payment, so an exchange link between Bitcoin and LR/Pecunix would give
   us 2nd-hop access to all that.  The possibility to cash out through
   them would help support the value of bitcoins.
   Bitcoin has unique properties that would be complementary.  LR/Pecunix
   are easy to spend anonymously, but hard to buy anonymously and not
   worth the trouble to buy in small amounts.  Bitcoin, on the other hand,
   is easy to get in small amounts anonymously.  It would be convenient to
   buy LR/Pecunix with bitcoins rather than through conventional payment
   methods.
   Most customers who convert to LR to buy something would probably ask
   the seller first if they accept Bitcoin, encouraging them to start
   accepting it.
