   Bitcoins are sent to and from bitcoin addresses, which are essentially
   random numbers with no identifying information.
   When you send to an IP address, the transaction is still written to a
   bitcoin address.  The IP address is only used to connect to the
   recipientʼs computer to request a fresh bitcoin address, give the
   transaction directly to the recipient and get a confirmation.
   Blocks contain a history of the bitcoin addresses that a coin has been
   transferred to.  If the identities of the people using the bitcoin
   addresses are not known and each address is used only once, then this
   information only reveals that some unknown person transferred some
   amount to someone else.
   The possibility to be anonymous or pseudonymous relies on you not
   revealing any identifying information about yourself in connection with
   the bitcoin addresses you use.  If you post your bitcoin address on the
   web, then youʼre associating that address and any transactions with it
   with the name you posted under.  If you posted under a handle that you
   havenʼt associated with your real identity, then youʼre still
   pseudonymous.
   For greater privacy, itʼs best to use bitcoin addresses only once.  You
   can change addresses as often as you want using Options->Change Your
   Address.  Transfers by IP address automatically use a new bitcoin
   address each time.

   No.

   In the next release (version 0.2), the command line to run it through a
   proxy from the first time is:
   bitcoin -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
   The problem for TOR is that the IRC server which Bitcoin uses to
   initially discover other nodes bans the TOR exit nodes, as all IRC
   servers do.  If youʼve already connected once before then youʼre
   already seeded, but for the first time, youʼd need to provide the
   address of a node as such:
   bitcoin -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -addnode=<someipaddress>
   If someone running a node with a static IP address that can accept
   incoming connections could post their IP to use for -addnode, that
   would be great.

   Whichever one youʼve set your NAT to forward port 8333 to will receive
   it.  If your router can change the port number when it forwards, you
   could allow more than one client to receive.  For instance, if port
   8334 forwards to a computerʼs port 8333, then senders could send to
   "x.x.x.x:8334"
   If your NAT canʼt translate port numbers, there currently isnʼt a
   command line option to change the incoming port that bitcoin binds to,
   but Iʼll look into it.
