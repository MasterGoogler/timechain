blocks minus 1

Bitcointalk

2010-08-16 15:59:25 UTC - [11]Original Post

   Iʼd like to reduce the number of blocks displayed in the status bar by
   1.   When you first load the program, itʼll display 0 blocks instead of
   1:
   "0 connections    0 blocks     0 transactions"
   Itʼs always been "nBestHeight + 1" because itʼs counting the genesis
   block.  Technically, yes, the genesis block is a block.  Itʼs a
   hardcoded block that you start out with.  You canʼt not have the
   genesis block.  Maybe think of it as a reference coin that you measure
   other coins against.  The block count people are looking for is the
   number of blocks theyʼve downloaded.
   The main benefit is that blocks will be equal to the block number of
   the current best block.  If blocks is 10, then the highest block number
   you have is 10.  It means you have block 10 and you donʼt have block
   11.
   It would reduce the confusion we had here:

   ... It already is on block 74638. I assume that means that block is now
   a good one?
   I had some confusion on this myself and got clarification in
   #bitcoin-dev:
   The bad block was number 74638, the last good one was 74637.  The
   numbers start at 0, so when your client shows there are 74638 blocks
   then that means you have up to block number 74637, the last good one.
