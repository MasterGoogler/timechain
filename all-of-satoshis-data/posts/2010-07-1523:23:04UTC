   I donʼt see either happening, although it did get put into the
   "Startup" folder.  That is so Windows 95ish (just kidding.....
   Microsoft has so screwed this up that it isnʼt even funny).  I would
   recommend the registry settings for a number of reasons including the
   fact that most software puts the startup in that location, even though
   I personally find the startup folder to be more attractive and how most
   software on Windows should behave.
   It could go either way.  The Startup folder has the advantage that the
   end user can see it and manually remove it with the regular UI (not
   regedit) if they already blew away the Bitcoin directory and its
   uninstaller.  Bitcoin will not relentlessly keep re-adding it if you
   delete it manually.
   OpenOffice is another example of something that puts its link in the
   Startup folder.
