Re: Slashdot Submission for 1.0

   BTW, I did come to my senses after that brief bout with 1.3, this
   release is still going to be 0.3 beta not 1.0.
   I really appreciate the effort, but there are a lot of problems.
   We donʼt want to lead with "anonymous".  (Iʼve been meaning to edit the
   homepage)
   "The developers expect that this will result in a
   stable-with-respect-to-energy currency outside the reach of any
   government." -- I am definitely not making an such taunt or assertion.
   Itʼs not stable-with-respect-to-energy.  There was a discussion on
   this.  Itʼs not tied to the cost of energy.  NLSʼs estimate based on
   energy was a good estimated starting point, but market forces will
   increasingly dominate.
   Sorry to be a wet blanket.  Writing a description for this thing for
   general audiences is bloody hard.  Thereʼs nothing to relate it to.
