Re: Questions about Addresses

   Port forwarding forwards a port to one computer.  It tells the router
   which computer handles connections to that port.  So thatʼs the
   computer receiving.
   If you didnʼt set up port forwarding, then incoming connections wonʼt
   go to any computer, and attempts to send to that IP would just say it
   couldnʼt connect to the recipient and nothing is sent.  When sending by
   IP, you still send to a bitcoin address, but your computer connects to
   that IP, gets a new bitcoin address from it, gives the transaction
   directly to the them and confirms that it was received and accepted.
   Someone should post their static IP so people can try out sending by IP
   and also give that user free money.
   Thereʼs a 32-bit checksum in bitcoin addresses so you canʼt
   accidentally type an invalid address.
   If 4) you send to a recipient who has abandoned or lost their
   wallet.dat, then the money is lost.  A subtle point can be made that
   since there is then less total money in circulation, everyoneʼs
   remaining money is worth slightly more, aka "natural deflation".
