Re: Website and software translations

   The order matters not to the program, but it matters to me maintaining
   it.  If it jumbles the order of the .po file then I canʼt diff for
   changes.  I have to update all 7 translation files when I change the
   English text in the program, and itʼs easier when theyʼre all in the
   same order.
   I can still put it back into normal order by making poedit rescan it.
   It is normal that untranslated strings are shown on top.

   By the way, there are some similar lines that possibly may be replaced
   by one. They are very close by meaning and differs only by 1-2 words.
   Just a suggestion of course.
   I know, but not easily without complicating the sourcecode.
