   OK, I made a build target bitcoind that only links wxBase and does not
   link GTK.  Version 0.2.7 on SVN.
   I split out the init and shutdown stuff from ui.cpp into init.cpp, so
   now ui.cpp is pure UI.  ui.h provides inline stubs if wxUSE_GUI=0.  We
   only have four functions that interface from the node to the UI.  In
   the bitcoind build, we donʼt link ui.o or uibase.o.

   It started increasing right away. Iʼll see if valgrind can help me.
   Sure feels like it could be something in wxWidgets retrying endlessly
   because some UI thing failed or something wasnʼt inited correctly.  Our
   hack to ignore the initialize failure and run anyway means weʼre in
   uncharted territory.  Weʼre relying on the fact that we hardly use wx
   in this mode.  We do still use a few things like wxGetTranslation and
   wxMutex.
   Another way to debug would be to run in gdb, wait until everything is
   quiet and all threads should be idle, and break it and see which thread
   is busily doing something and what itʼs doing.
   I suspect bitcoind will probably work fine, but I hope you can still
   debug the problem.
