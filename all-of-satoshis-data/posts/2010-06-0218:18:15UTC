Re: Hostnames instead of IP Addresses

Bitcointalk

2010-06-02 18:18:15 UTC - [11]Original Post

   The current sending by IP is not very useful: it connects to the IP, so
   youʼd like to use TOR for anonymity, but then it can totally be
   eavesdropped and man-in-the-middled.
   The future plan for sending to an IP is to make it a bitcoin address
   plus IP, like:
   1auaDZCFYqaGx4FKS5WenNfurk2SkoDu4h<someseparatorcharacter>1.2.3.4
   or
   1auaDZCFYqaGx4FKS5WenNfurk2SkoDu4h<someseparatorcharacter>domain.com
   I need suggestions for the separator character.  ":" is a candidate,
   but IPv6 has : in it and that might get confusing.  Something thatʼs
   allowed in url parameters would be nice.
   I want to use SSL for the connection, using the bitcoin addressʼ public
   key as the cert.  You would be certain youʼre connected to who you
   thought, and safely encrypted.  The bitcoin address would not be used
   for the transaction, only for authentication.  A new generated bitcoin
   address would be sent through the SSL connection.
   Since itʼs authenticated, it would then be safe to allow the IP address
   to be a domain name.  Some care taken that if a proxy is used, it uses
   socks4a instead of DNS lookup.
