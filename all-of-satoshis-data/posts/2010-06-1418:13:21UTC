Re: On IRC bootstrapping

Bitcointalk

2010-06-14 18:13:21 UTC - [11]Original Post

   Bitcoin has its own distributed address directory using the "addr"
   message.  Itʼs about time we coded in a list of the current long
   running static nodes to seed from.  I can add code so new nodes do not
   preferentially stay connected to the seed nodes, just connect and get
   the list, so it wonʼt be a burden on them.
   What do you think, should I go ahead with adding the seeds?
   Itʼll still try IRC first.  The IRC has the advantage that it lists
   nodes that are currently online, since they have to stay connected to
   stay on the list, but the disadvantage that itʼs a single point of
   failure.  The "addr" system has no single point of failure, but can
   only tell you what nodes have recently been seen, so it takes a little
   longer to get connected since some of the nodes you try have gone
   offline.  The combination of the two gets us the best of both worlds
   and more total robustness.
   Is there anyone who wants to volunteer to run an IRC server in case
   freenode gets tired of us?
