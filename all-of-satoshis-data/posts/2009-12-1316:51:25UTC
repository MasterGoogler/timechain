   There would be a command line switch at runtime to tell it to run
   without UI.  All it needs to do is not create the main window.  A
   simplistic way would be to disable "pframeMain->Show" and
   "ptaskbaricon->Show" in ui.cpp.  The network threads donʼt care that
   the UI isnʼt there.  The only other UI is a message box in
   CheckDiskSpace if it runs out of disk space.
   Then a separate command line utility to communicate with it to do
   things.  Not sure what it should be named.
   "natural deflation"... I like that name for it.  Yes, there will be
   natural deflation due to payment mistakes and lost data.  Coin creation
   will eventually get slow enough that it is exceeded by natural
   deflation and weʼll have net deflation.
