Re: Ummmm... where did my bitcoins go?

   Itʼs not the download so much as verifying all the signatures in all
   the blocks as it downloads that takes a long time.
   How long is the initial block download typically taking?  Does it slow
   down half way through or is about the same speed the whole way?
   Iʼve thought about ways to do a more cursory check of most of the chain
   up to the last few thousand blocks.  It is possible, but itʼs a lot of
   work, and there are a lot of other higher priority things to work on.
   Simplified Payment Verification is for lightweight client-only users
   who only do transactions and donʼt generate and donʼt participate in
   the node network.  They wouldnʼt need to download blocks, just the hash
   chain, which is currently about 2MB and very quick to verify (less than
   a second to verify the whole chain).  If the network becomes very
   large, like over 100,000 nodes, this is what weʼll use to allow common
   users to do transactions without being full blown nodes.  At that
   stage, most users should start running client-only software and only
   the specialist server farms keep running full network nodes, kind of
   like how the usenet network has consolidated.
   SPV is not implemented yet, and wonʼt be implemented until far in the
   future, but all the current implementation is designed around
   supporting it.
   In the meantime, sites like [12]vekja.net and [13]www.mybitcoin.com
   have been experimenting with account-based sites.  You create an
   account on a website and hold your bitcoins on account there and
   transfer in and out.  Creating an account on a website is a lot easier
   than installing and learning to use software, and a more familiar way
   of doing it for most people.  The only disadvantage is that you have to
   trust the site, but thatʼs fine for pocket change amounts for
   micropayments and misc expenses.  Itʼs an easy way to get started and
   if you get larger amounts then you can upgrade to the actual bitcoin
   software.
