Re: Privacy versus Safety: handling change

   We should queue up a supply of pre-made addresses in the wallet to use
   when a new address is needed.  They arenʼt very big, so it wouldnʼt
   hurt to have a lot of them.  This would more generally cover the case
   also where someone backs up, then requests a new address and receives a
   big payment with it.  Maybe there should be separate queues so one type
   of demand on addresses doesnʼt deplete it for the others.
   The addresses would be created and stored in the normal place, but also
   listed on a separate list of created-but-never-used addresses.  When an
   address is requested, the address at the front of the never-used queue
   is handed out, and a new address is created and added to the back.
   Thereʼs some kind of rescan in the block loading code that was made to
   repair the case where someone copied their wallet.dat.  I would need to
   check that the rescan handles the case of rediscovering received
   payments in blocks that were already received, but are forgotten
   because the wallet was restored.
