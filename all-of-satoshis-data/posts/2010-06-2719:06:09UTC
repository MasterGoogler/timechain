   Hereʼs an answer to a similar question about how to recover from a
   major meltdown.

   If SHA-256 became completely broken, I think we could come to some
   agreement about what the honest block chain was before the trouble
   started, lock that in and continue from there with a new hash function.
   If the hash breakdown came gradually, we could transition to a new hash
   in an orderly way.  The software would be programmed to start using a
   new hash after a certain block number.  Everyone would have to upgrade
   by that time.  The software could save the new hash of all the old
   blocks to make sure a different block with the same old hash canʼt be
   used.
