   I donʼt know anything about any of the bug trackers.  If we were to
   have one, we would have to make a thoroughly researched choice.
   Weʼre managing pretty well just using the forum.  Iʼm more likely to
   see bugs posted in the forum, and I think other users are much more
   likely to help resolve and ask follow up questions here than if they
   were in a bug tracker.  A key step is other users helping resolve the
   simple stuff thatʼs not really a bug but some misunderstanding or
   confusion.
   I keep a list of all unresolved bugs Iʼve seen on the forum.  In some
   cases, Iʼm still thinking about the best design for the fix.  This
   isnʼt the kind of software where we can leave so many unresolved bugs
   that we need a tracker for them.
