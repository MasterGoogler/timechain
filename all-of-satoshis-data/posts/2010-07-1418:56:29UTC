Re: Warning this block was not received by any other nodes

Bitcointalk

   Microsoft Security Essentials Live Protection is blocking your
   communication with the network.  You have connections, which tricks
   Bitcoin into thinking itʼs connected, but they are silent because the
   data is being blocked.
   You need to make bitcoin.exe an excluded process in Live Protection.
   This is becoming a common problem.  Someone should write this up in a
   pegged thread.
   The message "Warning: This block was not received by any other nodes"
   occurs when Bitcoin broadcasts a block, but nobody confirms they
   received it.  The warning is there just for this kind of situation,
   where for some reason you have connections, but they have gone dead and
   nobody can hear you.  Your block will never become valid because nobody
   received it.
