   Right now the transaction fee address is left "blank" and the block
   generator fills it out.
   Now you would fill it in with the address of the person you are asking
   to build the block.
   If youʼre only going to have one person work on building the block,
   that could take days.  Oh, do you mean send a different variation to
   each node with the tx fee written to them?
   The way it is now, itʼs whoever builds this gets it.
   If we needed to, we could have a BitTorrent-esque tit-for-tat for
   transaction broadcast.  Relay paying transactions to me, or I wonʼt
   relay them to you.  It probably wonʼt be an actual problem though.  It
   only takes one node relaying like it should to cancel out 7 others
   greedily not relaying.
