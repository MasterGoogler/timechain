Re: Bitcoin crash when sending coins

Bitcointalk

   The resync idea would go through your wallet and check it against the
   block index to find any transactions that your current computer doesnʼt
   realize are already spent.  That could happen if they were spent on
   another computer with a copy of the wallet file, or you had to restore
   the wallet to a backup from before they were spent.  Currently, the
   software just assumes it always knows whether its transactions are
   spent because it marks them spent in wallet.dat when it spends them.
   A wallet merge tool is possible to implement but much less in demand
   once resync solves most of the problem.  With resync, you could do
   about the same thing by sending all the money from one wallet to the
   other.  The receiver would resync and discover all its overlapping
   coins were spent, then receive them in the new transaction.
