Re: Fees in BitDNS confusion

   Not locktime.
   Thereʼs a possible design for far in the future:
   You intentionally write a double-spend.  You write it with the same
   inputs and outputs, but this time with a fee.  When your double-spend
   gets into a block, the first spend becomes invalid.  The payee does not
   really notice, because at the moment the new transaction becomes valid,
   the old one becomes invalid, and the new transaction simply takes its
   place.
   Itʼs easier said than implemented.  There would be a fair amount of
   work to make a client that correctly writes the double-spend, manages
   the two versions in the wallet until one is chosen, handles all the
   corner cases.  Every assumption in the existing code is that youʼre not
   trying to write double-spends.
   There would need to be some changes on the Bitcoin Miner side also, to
   make the possibility to accept a double-spend into the transaction
   pool, but only strictly if the inputs and outputs match and the
   transaction fee is higher.  Currently, double-spends are never accepted
   into the transaction pool, so every node bears witness to which
   transaction it saw first by working to put it into a block.
