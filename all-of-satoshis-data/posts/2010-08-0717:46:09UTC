Re: Bitcoin minting is thermodynamically perverse

   Itʼs the same situation as gold and gold mining.  The marginal cost of
   gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold.  Gold mining is a
   waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold
   available as a medium of exchange.
   I think the case will be the same for Bitcoin.  The utility of the
   exchanges made possible by Bitcoin will far exceed the cost of
   electricity used.  Therefore, not having Bitcoin would be the net
   waste.

   As an overall point, I also do not agree with the idea that the very
   high computational burden of coin generation is in fact a necessity of
   the current system. As I understand it, currency creation is
   fundamentally metered by TIME - and if that is the fundamental
   controlling variable, what is the need for everyone to "roll as many
   dice as posible" within that given time period? The "chain of proof"
   for coin ownership and transactions doesnʼt depend on the method for
   spawning coins.
   Each nodeʼs influence on the network is proportional to its CPU power.
    The only way to show the network how much CPU power you have is to
   actually use it.
   If thereʼs something else each person has a finite amount of that we
   could count for one-person-one-vote, I canʼt think of it.  IP
   addresses... much easier to get lots of them than CPUs.
   I suppose it might be possible to measure CPU power at certain times.
   For instance, if the CPU power challenge was only run for an average of
   1 minute every 10 minutes.  You could still prove your total power at
   given times without running it all the time.  Iʼm not sure how that
   could be implemented though.  Thereʼs no way for a node that wasnʼt
   present at the time to know that a past chain was actually generated in
   a duty cycle with 9 minute breaks, not back to back.
   Proof-of-work has the nice property that it can be relayed through
   untrusted middlemen.  We donʼt have to worry about a chain of custody
   of communication.  It doesnʼt matter who tells you a longest chain, the
   proof-of-work speaks for itself.
