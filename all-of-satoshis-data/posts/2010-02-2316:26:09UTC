Re: Bitcoin Address Collisions

Bitcointalk

2010-02-23 16:26:09 UTC - [11]Original Post

   Thereʼs a separate public/private keypair for every bitcoin address.
   You donʼt have a single private key that unlocks everything.  Bitcoin
   addresses are a 160-bit hash of the public key, everything else in the
   system is 256-bit.
   If there was a collision, the collider could spend any money sent to
   that address.  Just money sent to that address, not the whole wallet.
   If you were to intentionally try to make a collision, it would
   currently take 2^126 times longer to generate a colliding bitcoin
   address than to generate a block.  You could have got a lot more money
   by generating blocks.
   The random seed is very thorough.  On Windows, it uses all the
   performance monitor data that measures every bit of disk performance,
   network card metrics, cpu time, paging etc. since your computer
   started.  Linux has a built-in entropy collector.  Adding to that,
   every time you move your mouse inside the Bitcoin window youʼre
   generating entropy, and entropy is captured from the timing of disk
   ops.
