Re: Idea for file hosting service

   Thatʼs a great idea.  Thereʼs a thriving business in those services,
   but Iʼve always thought the standard payment methods are at odds with
   privacy minded customers.
   Would you consider making your software freely available so anyone
   could easily set one up?  I know for competitive reasons the
   inclination is to keep it to yourself, but it could get an order of
   magnitude more use if anyone could give proxy access to their country
   just by putting the software on a server.
   I wonder if there are other kinds of web application servers where we
   would only have to tack on the payment mechanism to an already existing
   system?
