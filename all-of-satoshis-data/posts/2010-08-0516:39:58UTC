   The only solution to this problem is to make broadcasting of a
   transaction "non free".  Namely, if you want me to include it you have
   to pay me.  The net (no pun intended) result is that each client would
   need to pay other clients to whom they even send their transaction, not
   just the individual who gets it in a block.   In this way the laws of
   economics take over and no one gets a free ride on the transaction
   broadcast system.
   I donʼt know a way to implement that.  The transaction fee to the block
   creator uses a special trick to include the transaction fee without any
   additional size.  If there was a transaction for each transaction fee,
   then what about the transactions fees for the transaction feeʼs
   transaction?
