Re: Won't let me send coins because it requires a transaction fee?

Bitcointalk

   What version is the one where this happened?  Release build, or built
   it yourself?  Which operating system?
   Were you sending by IP or by Bitcoin Address?
   When you sent 49.99, did it prompt you to pay a 0.01 fee?
   There was a change in GetMinFee, but I canʼt see how it would cause
   this.  It only starts to apply when a block gets huge.
   The reason for the difference in block number is the number displayed
   was reduced by 1 in 0.3.11 because it made more sense that way.
