Re: Runaway CPU usage for 64bit BitCoin (Linux Client)

Bitcointalk

2010-07-14 18:45:53 UTC - [11]Original Post

   After it initially tries incorrectly to set itself to the lowest
   priority, the generate thread only changes its priority again
   temporarily when it finds a block.  When youʼve found a block, you
   should want it to hurry up and broadcast it as soon a possible before
   someone else finds one and makes yours invalid.  The generate thread
   only changes to higher priority for less than a second every few days.
   There should be a 0.3.1 release for this soon.  There are a few other
   issues we need to look at fixing in 0.3.1 before making a release.

   On a side note, Iʼve tracked down the other GUI issue.
   The "minimize to tray instead of taskbar" is what was eating up all the
   CPU on my system. After I turned this off, the issue was resolved with
   Runaway CPU.
   This only seems to affect the 64 bit Client, as the 32 bit Clients I
   have donʼt seem to be affected by this.
   I did notice on the 64 bit Client, what happens is, it spawns multiple
   "tray" icons until X server finally kills over, so I guess I should
   submit that as a bug to somewhere?  Huh
   Thatʼs interesting.  I know the minimize to tray on Ubuntu is very
   clunky, but I didnʼt know it had a CPU peg problem too.  Anyone else
   able to reproduce this problem?  We had this feature disabled on Linux
   before, but then it seemed better to have the imperfect UI than to lose
   the feature entirely.  Iʼm thinking we should disable it again on
   Linux.
