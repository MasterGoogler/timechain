   additional block chains would each create their own flavor of coins,
   which would trade with bitcoins on exchanges? These chain-specific
   coins would be used to reward miners on those chains, and to purchase
   some kinds of rights or privileges within the domain of that chain?
   Right, the exchange rate between domains and bitcoins would float.
   A longer interval than 10 minutes would be appropriate for BitDNS.
   So far in this discussion thereʼs already a lot of housekeeping data
   required.  It will be much easier if you can freely use all the space
   you need without worrying about paying fees for expensive space in
   Bitcoinʼs chain.  Some transactions:
   Changing the IP record.
   Name change.  A domain object could entitle you to one domain, and you
   could change it at will to any name that isnʼt taken.  This would
   encourage users to free up names they donʼt want anymore.  Generated
   domains start out blank and the miner sells it to someone who changes
   it to what they want.
   Renewal.  Could be free, or maybe require consuming another domain
   object to renew.  In that case, domain objects (domaincoins?) could
   represent the right to own a domain for a year.  The spent fee goes to
   the miners in the next block fee.
