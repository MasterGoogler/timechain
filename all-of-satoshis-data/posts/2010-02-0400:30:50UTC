Re: TOR and I2P

   When using proxy port 9050, it will only make one attempt to connect to
   IRC, then give up, since it knows it will probably always fail because
   IRC servers ban all the TOR exit nodes.  If youʼre using another port,
   it would assume it might be a regular old normal proxy and would keep
   retrying IRC at longer and longer intervals.  You should not use Polipo
   or Privoxy as those are http filters and caches that would corrupt
   Bitcoinʼs messages if they make any changes.  Bitcoin might be trying
   to overcome it by reconnecting.  You should use port 9050.
   As riX says, the "is giving Tor only an IP address. Apps that do
   DNS..." warnings are nothing to worry about.  Bitcoin doesnʼt use DNS
   at all in proxy mode.
   Since Bitcoin canʼt get through to IRC through Tor, it doesnʼt know
   which nodes are currently online, so it has to try all the recently
   seen nodes.  It tries to conserve connection attempts as much as
   possible, but also people want it to connect quickly when they start it
   up and reconnect quickly if disconnected.  It uses an algorithm where
   it tries an IP less and less frequently the longer ago it was
   successful connected.  For example, for a node it saw 24 hours ago, it
   would wait 5 hours between connection attempts.  Once it has at least 2
   connections, it wonʼt try anything over a week old, and 5 connections
   it wonʼt try anything over 24 hours old.
