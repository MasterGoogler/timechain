Re: I broke my wallet, sends never confirm now.

   As you figured out, the root problem is we shouldnʼt be counting or
   spending transactions until they have at least 1 confirmation.
   0/unconfirmed transactions are very much second class citizens.  At
   most, they are advice that something has been received, but counting
   them as balance or spending them is premature.
   I made changes so they show up in lighter print, with the credit amount
   in square brackets like [+1.23], and the amount not counted towards
   your balance and not available for spending.  This doesnʼt apply to
   transactions you sent, which you implicitly trust, since you wrote
   them.
   I didnʼt make it (+1.23) because parenthesis in accounting means
   negative.  I hope square brackets is different enough to be clear what
   is meant.
   The JSON-RPC interface can still see 0/unconfirmed if it wants by
   specifying 0 confirmations.
   I uploaded the changes to SVN rev 158.  I will post a 0.3.13 RC
   shortly.
   If you have any of these transactions in your wallet, do not send any
   payments until youʼve upgraded to 0.3.13, which will be coming soon.
   If youʼve already sent any of these transactions, or youʼre the creator
   of them, then use theymosʼ patch or make the following change and use
   it to send your clean transactions to a new wallet to clean things up.
   change:
       if (pcoin->GetDepthInMainChain() < 1 && pcoin->GetDebit() <= 0)
           continue;
   to:
       if (pcoin->GetDepthInMainChain() < 1)
           continue;
