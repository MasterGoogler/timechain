Re: On IRC bootstrapping

   Thanks soultcer for talking with the Freenode staffer.  Good to know
   itʼs OK at the current size, and now they know who we are.  Theyʼre
   supportive of projects like TOR so I hope they would probably be
   friendly to us.  We donʼt want to overstay our welcome.  If we get too
   big, then by the same token, weʼre big enough that we donʼt need IRC
   anymore and weʼll get off.
   We only needed IRC because nobody had a static IP.  In the early days
   there were some steady supporters, but they all had pool-allocated IPs
   that change every few days.  IRC was only intended as a temporary
   solution.  Bitcoinʼs built-in addr system is the main solution.
   Bitcoin can get the list of IPs from any bitcoin node.  In that sense,
   every node serves as a directory server.
   When there are enough static IP nodes to have a good chance that at
   least one will still be running by the time the current version goes
   out of use, we can preprogram a seed list.
   How do you think we should compile the seed list?  Would it be OK to
   create it from the currently connected IPs that have been static for a
   while?
   BTW, if we want to supplement by deploying separate directory server
   software, may I suggest IRC?  IRC is a good directory server (Iʼve
   heard it has other uses too), and there are mature IRC server
   implementations available that anyone can run. Smiley   Bitcoinʼs IRC
   client implementation is already thoroughly tested.
