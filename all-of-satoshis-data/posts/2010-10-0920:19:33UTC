Key pool feature for safer wallet backup

Bitcointalk

2010-10-09 20:19:33 UTC - [11]Original Post

   SVN rev 163 (ver 0.3.13.3) has the key pool feature.  Pre-generated new
   keys are aged in a queue before use, so that backups of wallet.dat hold
   keys youʼll use in the future.
   For now I made the default pool size 100.  It can be configured with
   -keypool=.  Be aware, it takes a little time to increase the pool size,
   so donʼt go crazy with it.  Disk space is about 1K per key.
   I have not addressed the recovery side of this yet.  If you actually
   did restore an old wallet.dat, I think you may have to delete blk*.dat
   to rediscover your own transactions during the redownload.
   Iʼve only tested this moderately.  You might not want to use this for a
   website server until itʼs had some more testing.
