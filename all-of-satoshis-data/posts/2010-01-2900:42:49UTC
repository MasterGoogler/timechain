Re: 64bit support

Bitcointalk

2010-01-29 00:42:49 UTC - [11]Original Post

   I committed a fix for 64-bit compile and some fixes to support
   wxWidgets 2.9.0.
   There was one compile error in serialize.h with min(sizeof()) that I
   fixed for 64-bit.  The rest of the 64-bit compile errors I was getting
   were in wxWidgets 2.8.9, so I started working on supporting wxWidgets
   2.9.0.
   wxWidgets 2.9.0 is UTF-8.  Weʼve been using the ANSI version of
   wxWidgets 2.8.9 in anticipation of wxWidgets UTF-8 support.
   I compiled and ran on 64-bit Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic.
   I think the only bug left is where the status number is mashed up.  Iʼm
   not sure why, I have to suspect itʼs a UTF-8 thing, but no idea how
   that could happen.  Havenʼt looked into it.
   build-unix.txt is updated and two makefiles on SVN:
   makefile.unix.wx2.8
   makefile.unix.wx2.9
   Unfortunately thereʼs still no debian package for either version of
   wxWidgets we use.  They only have the wchar ("unicode") version of
   wxWidgets 2.8, which is a disaster because wchar wxString doesnʼt
   convert to std::string.  We use either ANSI wxWidgets 2.8, or wxWidgets
   2.9.  So you still have to get it and build it yourself.
