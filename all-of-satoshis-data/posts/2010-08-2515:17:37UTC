Re: Development of alert system

Bitcointalk

2010-08-25 15:17:37 UTC - [11]Original Post

   It canʼt do arbitrary actions remotely.  Maybe some of you are
   responding to other posters who suggested the alert system should do
   more?
   If there is an alert, the following json-rpc methods return an error:
   sendtoaddress
   getbalance
   getreceivedbyaddress
   getreceivedbylabel
   listreceivedbyaddress
   listreceivedbylabel
   The remaining 14 methods function as normal.
   I believe the safer option should be enabled by default.  If you want
   your server to keep trading and ignore an alert saying the money its
   receiving might be like the money from the overflow bug, then you can
   use the switch and not blame anyone else if you lose your money.
   Worst case if you leave alerts enabled, your site stops trading until
   you upgrade or add the -disablesafemode switch.
   Getting surprised by some temporary down time when your node would
   otherwise be at risk is better than getting surprised by a thief
   draining all your inventory.
   Someday when we havenʼt found any new bugs for a long time and it has
   been thoroughly security reviewed without finding anything, this can be
   scaled back.  Iʼm not arguing that this is the permanent way of things
   forever.  Itʼs still beta software.
