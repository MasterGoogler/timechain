   Here is a paper that claims to find SHA-1 collisions in 2^52 crypto
   operations. And optimally secure hash would take 2^80 operations. 2^52
   time is still large, but it is getting into cluster and botnet range.
   2^80 is if you can use a birthday attack.  You canʼt use a birthday
   attack for this, so the difficulty is the full 2^160 bits.  Although,
   if you were trying to crack any one of 1 million (2^20) transactions,
   you could do a partial birthday attack 2^160/2^20 = 2^140.
   Bitcoin Addresses are the only place where 160-bit hash is used.
   Everything else is SHA-256.  Theyʼre calculated as:
   bitcoinaddress = RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(publickey))
   Correct me if Iʼm wrong (please, and Iʼll gladly eat crow) but I think
   it would be hard to use an analytical attack on RIPEMD-160 in this
   case.  An analytical attack prescribes a certain range or pattern of
   inputs to try that will greatly increase your chance of finding a
   collision.  Here, you donʼt have that kind of control over RIPEMD-160ʼs
   input, because the input is the output of SHA-256.  If an analytical
   attack helps you find an input to RIPEMD-160 that produces a collision,
   what are you going to do with it?  You still have to get SHA-256 to
   output that value, so you would still have to break SHA-256 too.
   For brute force, RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(x)) is no stronger than RIPEMD-160
   alone.  But for analytical attack, it seems like you must analytical
   attack both RIPEMD-160 and SHA-256.  If Iʼm wrong, then the strength is
   the same as RIPEMD-160 and the SHA-256 only serves as one round of key
   strengthening.
