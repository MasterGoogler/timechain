   ArtForz is already running with no fees, and he has 20-30% of the
   networkʼs CPU power. The person who originally sent the broken
   transactions deleted his wallet, though, and the network has forgotten
   these historical transactions, so any transactions based on this wonʼt
   confirm.
   Transactions arenʼt accepted or displayed as 0/unconfirmed until your
   node has a path of transactions back to the block chain.
   Any transactions in your wallet also have bundled with them all
   unrecorded transactions required to reach the block chain.  If you have
   a transaction that is displayed as 0/unconfirmed, then you have all the
   previous unrecorded transactions it depends on and you will also
   rebroadcast those transactions when you rebroadcast yours.
   If a no-fee block has already been generated and hasnʼt helped, then I
   need to look at whatʼs wrong.  Itʼs a part of code that doesnʼt get
   much use.  They should be recorded in the wallets of everyone who has a
   transaction depending on them.

   Sigh... why delete a wallet instead of moving it aside and keeping the
   old copy just in case?  You should never delete a wallet.

   Itʼs running. Should find a block within 3 hours.
   It may take a while to collect re-broadcast transactions.  Itʼll help
   if you can accept inbound connections so youʼll be listening to more
   nodes.  Even if you find a block in 3 hours, keep it running
   continuously for a few days at least.
