   Adding transactions to the block youʼre working on will slow down your
   generation rate
   The premise is false.  Adding more transactions to the block youʼre
   working on does NOT slow down your generation rate.  When generate is
   scanning hashes, it only hashes the header of the block, which is
   constant size.  The header contains a hash of the transactions (the
   Merkle root) and is only updated occasionally.
   If necessary I can write code to make nodes prefer not to use a block
   if it doesnʼt contain enough of the transactions they know about.  A
   discouraged block would almost always fail to be included in the main
   chain, but would be accepted if it did get in.  I doubt this will be
   necessary, since thereʼs no real advantage for nodes not to include all
   transactions.
