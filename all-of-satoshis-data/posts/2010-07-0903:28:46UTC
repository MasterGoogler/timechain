   What the OP described is called "cornering the market".  When someone
   tries to buy all the worldʼs supply of a scarce asset, the more they
   buy the higher the price goes.  At some point, it gets too expensive
   for them to buy any more.  Itʼs great for the people who owned it
   beforehand because they get to sell it to the corner at crazy high
   prices.  As the price keeps going up and up, some people keep holding
   out for yet higher prices and refuse to sell.
   The Hunt brothers famously bankrupted themselves trying to corner the
   silver market in 1979:
   "Brothers Nelson Bunker Hunt and Herbert Hunt attempted to corner the
   world silver markets in the late 1970s and early 1980s, at one stage
   holding the rights to more than half of the worldʼs deliverable
   silver.[1] During Huntʼs accumulation of the precious metal silver
   prices rose from $11 an ounce in September 1979 to nearly $50 an ounce
   in January 1980.[2] Silver prices ultimately collapsed to below $11 an
   ounce two months later,[2] much of the fall on a single day now known
   as Silver Thursday, due to changes made to exchange rules regarding the
   purchase of commodities on margin.[3]"
