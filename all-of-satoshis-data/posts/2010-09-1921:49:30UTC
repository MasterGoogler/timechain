Re: The case for removing IP transactions

Bitcointalk

2010-09-19 21:49:30 UTC - [11]Original Post

   Probably best to disable receiving by IP unless you specifically intend
   to use it.  This is a lot of surface area that nobody uses that doesnʼt
   need to be open by default.
   In storefront cases, you would typically only want customers to send
   payments through your automated system that only hands out bitcoin
   addresses associated with particular orders and accounts.  Random
   unidentified payments volunteered to the serverʼs IP address would be
   unhelpful.
   In general, sending by IP has limited useful cases.  If connecting
   directly without a proxy, the man-in-the-middle risk may be tolerable,
   but no privacy.  If you use a privacy proxy, man-in-the-middle risk is
   unacceptably high.  If we went to all the work of implementing SSL,
   only large storefronts usually go to the trouble of getting a CA cert,
   but most of those cases would still be better off to use bitcoin
   addresses.
   I uploaded this change to SVN rev 156.  The switch to enable is
   "-allowreceivebyip".
   Senders with this version will get the error "Recipient is not
   accepting transactions sent by IP address".  Older version senders will
   get "Transfer was not accepted".
   I used a different name for the switch because "-allowiptransactions"
   sounds like it includes sending.  If thereʼs a better name for the
   switch, we can change it again.
