Re: How fast do the fastest computers generate bitcoins?

   Iʼve noticed that hashing performance doesnʼt vary as much between CPUs
   as youʼd expect.  Compared to an old CPU, a newer CPU doesnʼt show as
   much of a speedup at hashing as it does on general benchmarks.
   I guess recent CPU optimizations must have concentrated on things like
   I/O and branch prediction.  Most programs are a bunch of memory access,
   comparisons and branching, they rarely get down to cranking away at
   maths for very long.
   The latest SVN version has a khash/s display.  Around 400 khash/s per
   processor is typical.
