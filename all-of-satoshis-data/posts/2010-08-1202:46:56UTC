   I believe the clients would have to keep the entire history back to the
   original generated coins.  The fact that clients have to keep the
   entire history reduces the privacy benefit.
   I thought this too at first. But then I convinced myself otherwise.
   Are you back to talking about the existing Bitcoin system here?
   I was talking about in the hypothetical system I was describing, if the
   network doesnʼt know the values and lineage of the transactions, then
   it canʼt verify them and vouch for them, so the clients would have to
   keep the history all the way back.
   If a client wasnʼt present until recently, the two ways to convince it
   that a transaction has a valid past is:
   1) Show it the entire history back to the original generated coin.
   2) Show it a history back to a thoroughly deep block, then trust that
   if so many nodes all said the history up to then was correct then it
   must be true.
   But if the network didnʼt know all the values and lineage of the
   transactions, it couldnʼt do 2), I donʼt think.
