Re: Is my second Transaction working correctly? +Transfer Question

   The transfer is immediate if you send by IP address.  If you send by
   bitcoin address and the recipient isnʼt online at the time, it might
   take 30 minutes or more to see it.
   Also, the recipient needs to be synced up with the block chain before
   itʼll see the received transaction.  That means the status bar at the
   bottom needs to say at least 33000 blocks, like "x connections  33200
   blocks  x transactions".

   However, once that transaction was complete, a new transaction hasnʼt
   started. Or maybe it has. Thereʼs only one transaction in the list but
   Iʼm up to 131 Blocks under "Status". Is this the way itʼs supposed to
   happen? Does it keep processing on the same transaction and generating
   coins every 120 blocks or so? Or is it supposed to start a new
   transaction?
   The number of blocks of a transaction is the amount of new blocks that
   have been generated by the whole network after the transaction. Each
   new block in the chain means new coins to its creator. One "generated"
   -transaction in your transaction list means that you have generated one
   block. Youʼre not the first one to find the concept of a "block" a bit
   confusing on the first sight.
   Would it be clearer if the status said "x confirmations", like:
   2/unconfirmed
   3/unconfirmed
   4/unconfirmed
   5/unconfirmed
   6 confirmations
   7 confirmations
   8 confirmations
   Each block essentially means another node has confirmed that it agrees
   with all transactions up to that point.
