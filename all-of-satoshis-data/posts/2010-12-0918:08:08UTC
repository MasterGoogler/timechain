   I agree with you and satoshi about "txs after <txid>".  My
   listtransactions (now xlisttransactions) patch pointedly does not have
   that feature, and never has.
   As long as the interface is designed for things like showing the user
   the last N transactions history, itʼs fine, now that we have the
   Accounts feature making it easier to do payment detection the right
   way.
   Gavin, could listtransactions have an option to list transactions for
   all accounts?
   Iʼm not sure what the interface could be, maybe:
   listtransactions <JSON null type> [count]
   It would be hard to do that from the command line though.
   I canʼt think of a good solution for the interface, thatʼs the
   problem.  Maybe "*" special case like "" is.  Everyone would have to
   make sure no user can create account name "*".

   Sure, and thatʼs easy enough to track with transactions.
   I donʼt get how thatʼs "easy" to track with transactions.
