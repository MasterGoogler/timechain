   I donʼt know.  Maybe someone with more Linux experience knows how to
   install the library it needs.
   I built it on Ubuntu 10.04.  I hope that wasnʼt a mistake.  Maybe it
   should have been built on an older version for more backward
   compatibility.  Is this a problem on Linux, that if you build on the
   latest version, then it has trouble working on older versions?  Is
   there any way I can downgrade to an older version of GCC on 10.04?
   The 64-bit version shouldnʼt be any faster than the 32-bit version, but
   it would be great if someone could do a side-by-side comparison of the
   two linux versions and check.  SHA-256 is a 32-bit algorithm and
   nothing in BitcoinMiner uses 64-bit at all.
   We donʼt need to bother with a 64-bit version for Windows.  32-bit
   programs work on all versions of Windows.  Itʼs not like Linux where
   the 64-bit OS wants 64-bit programs.
   Iʼm also curious if itʼs a little faster on linux than windows.
   Do you think I should make the directories:
   /bin32/
   /bin64/
   instead of
   /bin/32/
   /bin/64/
