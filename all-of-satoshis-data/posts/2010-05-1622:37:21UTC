   A freenet URI is like this:
   [13]http://127.0.0.1:8888/USK@oshw3DxmJUt7q4ThF4dCez5IXbc9hCGcv0VuwLRCm
   eQ,ckeXv20F1gBzkqssB4RXHZ2nB1YRT8Pb8KYZk8wj-bs,AQACAAE/occamsrazor/6/f.
   pdf
   There you go, we could easily do it the same way, like:
   [14]http://127.0.0.1:8330/?to=<bitcoinaddress>;amount=<amount>
   Bitcoin can answer port 8330 on local loopback just as it does for
   JSON-RPC on 8332.  It would give an HTTP answer.

   A bitcoin-link should be more like mailto: than magnet: IMHO.
   I think we can do that.
   Although it would be possible for Bitcoin to take care of business in
   the HTTP response by presenting HTML UI to the user, as a user I would
   wonder if some website is trying to trick me or if Iʼm really talking
   to my own Bitcoin server.
   The HTTP response could simply be HTML with the JavaScript equivalent
   of the back button, sending it back to the page.  Bitcoin then pops up
   the Send Bitcoins dialog with the destination bitcoin address and
   amount already filled in.  It would work just like a mailto: link that
   pops up a new email with the address filled in.
   127.0.0.1 loopback is accessible by any user on the machine, it doesnʼt
   have per-user separation, but itʼs OK because it would only serve the
   convenience function of pre-filling the fields in a dialog.  Youʼd
   still have to press Send.  Weʼd have to make sure the Send button is
   not selected so it couldnʼt jump into the foreground while youʼre
   typing a space or enter.
