Re: BitDNS and Generalizing Bitcoin

Bitcointalk

2010-12-10 17:29:28 UTC - [11]Original Post

   Piling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset
   doesnʼt scale.
   Bitcoin and BitDNS can be used separately.  Users shouldnʼt have to
   download all of both to use one or the other.  BitDNS users may not
   want to download everything the next several unrelated networks decide
   to pile in either.
   The networks need to have separate fates.  BitDNS users might be
   completely liberal about adding any large data features since
   relatively few domain registrars are needed, while Bitcoin users might
   get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so
   itʼs easy for lots of users and small devices.
   Fears about securely buying domains with Bitcoins are a red herring.
   Itʼs easy to trade Bitcoins for other non-repudiable commodities.
   If youʼre still worried about it, itʼs cryptographically possible to
   make a risk free trade.  The two parties would set up transactions on
   both sides such that when they both sign the transactions, the second
   signerʼs signature triggers the release of both.  The second signer
   canʼt release one without releasing the other.
