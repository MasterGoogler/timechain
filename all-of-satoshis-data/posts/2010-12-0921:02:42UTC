Re: BitDNS and Generalizing Bitcoin

   I think it would be possible for BitDNS to be a completely separate
   network and separate block chain, yet share CPU power with Bitcoin.
   The only overlap is to make it so miners can search for proof-of-work
   for both networks simultaneously.
   The networks wouldnʼt need any coordination.  Miners would subscribe to
   both networks in parallel.  They would scan SHA such that if they get a
   hit, they potentially solve both at once.  A solution may be for just
   one of the networks if one network has a lower difficulty.
   I think an external miner could call getwork on both programs and
   combine the work.  Maybe call Bitcoin, get work from it, hand it to
   BitDNS getwork to combine into a combined work.
   Instead of fragmentation, networks share and augment each otherʼs total
   CPU power.  This would solve the problem that if there are multiple
   networks, they are a danger to each other if the available CPU power
   gangs up on one.  Instead, all networks in the world would share
   combined CPU power, increasing the total strength.  It would make it
   easier for small networks to get started by tapping into a ready base
   of miners.
