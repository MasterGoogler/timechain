   However, itʼs important that you donʼt lock all the way up the very
   latest block.  Otherwise, the attacker could generate a fake block (or
   a few) right before you happen to lock it, and then his attack would be
   far easier than it would have been without the block lock.
   I went about 200 blocks back.  The block chain was a clean straight
   line without branches, and there was only one known version of the
   locked block.

   Also, Iʼm assuming that the block lock means that the blocks will also
   come prepackaged with the client.  Is this so?
   Sorry, not yet, but I do want to make the initial block download
   faster.
