   Perhaps in addition to the age priority rule recently implimented,
   there should be a minimum age rule without a transaction fee.  Said
   another way, perhaps a generation rule that says that a free
   transaction must be 3 blocks deep before it can be transfered again for
   free.  This will still allow real users to immediately spend new funds
   if they have to, while still permitting real users to reshuffle funds
   to suit their needs without an overhead cost.  I think that this would
   significantly inhibit the type of spamming attack that is currently
   underway.
   Iʼm doing something like that.  Priority is a more formalised version
   of the concept youʼre describing.

   As it stands now 3.15 has a lot of free transaction space and that
   space is given first to transactions with the highest
   [age]*[value]/[size] correct? Would it be reasonable to make some
   arbitrary portion of the free space require [age]*[value]/[size] > C ?
   Maybe set C so that a standard 1BTC transaction can get into the main
   free area on the next block. And a .1 can get in after waiting about 10
   blocks. And make the area which allows [age]*[value]/[size] < C to let
   in about a dozen transactions or so.
   Yes, like this.  And the no-priority-requirement area is 3K, about a
   dozen transactions per block.
   I just uploaded SVN rev 185 which has a minimal priority requirement
   for free transactions.  Transaction floods are made up of coins that
   are re-spent over and over, so they depend on their own 0 conf
   transactions repeatedly.  0 conf transactions have 0 priority, so free
   transactions like that will have to wait for one transaction to get
   into a block at a time.
   Version 0.3.15 doesnʼt write transactions using 0 conf dependencies
   unless thatʼs all it has left, so normal users shouldnʼt usually have a
   problem with this.
   I think this is a good compromise short of making the default fee 0.01.
    Itʼs not so much to ask that free transactions can only be used to
   turn coins over so often.  If youʼre using free transactions, youʼre
   taking charity and there has to be some limit on how often you can use
   it with the same coins.
   Weʼve always said free transactions may be processed more slowly.  You
   can help ensure your transactions go through quickly by adding
   -paytxfee=0.01.
