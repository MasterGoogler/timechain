Re: A few suggestions

Bitcointalk

   What you can currently do is set "Minimize to the tray" in options,
   then run it as "bitcoin -min" so it starts minimized.  The only visible
   part will be a small (20x20) icon on the tray, which can be
   doubleclicked if you want to access the UI.  Note: thereʼs a bug with
   tray icons sometimes disappearing on 64-bit Karmic Koala, not sure if
   itʼs from 64-bit or Karmic, it was fine on 32-bit Jaunty.
   We didnʼt have time to implement the "Start Bitcoin on system startup"
   feature on Linux in time for 0.2 so itʼs greyed out.  I figured Linux
   people wouldnʼt mind doing that manually anyway.  I guess they need to
   know about the -min switch to do it right.
   You can locate the data directory where you want with the
   "-datadir=<directory>" switch.  I know someone is already doing that to
   put it on a TrueCrypt USB drive.
