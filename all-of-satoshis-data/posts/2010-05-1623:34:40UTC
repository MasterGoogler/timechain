Re: removing bitcoin addresses

Bitcointalk

   SheriffWoody:
   Bitcoin addresses you generate are kept forever.  A bitcoin address
   must be kept to show ownership of anything sent to it.  If you were
   able to delete a bitcoin address and someone sent to it, the money
   would be lost.  Theyʼre only about 500 bytes.
   sirius-m:
   Thousands of own addresses should not be any problem at all.  If youʼve
   generated 50000 BTC, then you already have 1000 own addresses, one for
   each 50 generated.  Those are hidden, theyʼre not shown in the UI.
   It would be a good idea to add a little code that keeps giving the same
   address to the same IP.  Hereʼs what I did in C++ to keep giving the
   same key (aka bitcoin address) until they use it:
       // Keep giving the same key to the same ip until they use it
       if (!mapReuseKey.count(pfrom->addr.ip))
           mapReuseKey[pfrom->addr.ip] = GenerateNewKey();

       ...sends the key mapReuseKey[pfrom->addr.ip]
   ...later...
       // Received something with this key
       mapReuseKey.erase(pfrom->addr.ip);
   If itʼs not convenient to know when youʼve received, just clear the
   cached keys every 20 minutes.
   I want to add a parameter to getnewaddress for number of days to expire
   if nothing is received with the address.
