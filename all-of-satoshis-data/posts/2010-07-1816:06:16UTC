   I think youʼre misunderstanding the issue. My browser will always be
   able to go to 127.0.0.1 (barring some strange IE settings or a virus).
   If I type the address into the URL bar or click a link, it will work
   fine. However, it isnʼt possible to use Javascript to complete POST
   requests between domains (or ports on the same domain).
   Thatʼs what I thought too.

   Yeah, I meant to say that cross-domain javascript calls are forbidden,
   so you canʼt call 127.0.0.1 from a javascript that doesnʼt reside in
   127.0.0.1. Come to think of it, it would be quite funny if browsers
   allowed malicious cross-domain javascript to change peopleʼs Facebook
   pages etc.
   Now Iʼm hearing a report that it IS possible for javascript to do a
   cross-domain POST request to 127.0.0.1.  Not other domains, but just
   specifically to that one.  Great...
   If this is the case, then do not use the -server switch or bitcoind on
   a system where you do web browsing.
   Iʼll get started on adding the password field.
