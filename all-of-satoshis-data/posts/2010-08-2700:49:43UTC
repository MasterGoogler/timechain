   Try -datadir=
   Last time I tried $(shell /usr/bin/wx-config), there was immediate
   hollering about build problems with it.  There wasnʼt time to
   investigate at the time.
   One problem with $(shell /usr/bin/wx-config) is it will pick up any
   version (wx 2.8 ) and any configuration (non-UTF-8 ) of wxWidgets that
   happens to be there.  -lwx_gtk2ud-2.9 only matches the right
   configuration.  It fails if wxWidgets was built with the wrong
   configuration.

   Iirc, chatting in #wxwidgets on freenode, the devs there were baffled
   why that was used.
   Did they say why they were baffled?

   This is because on my system the path is /usr/include/wx-2.9/wx/wx.h
   Why is it there?  Was it included by the OS, or did you have to build
   it?  If you built it, I wonder why it would put itself in a different
   place.
   Has wxWidgets 2.9 finally started to become available as a debian
   package?
   Maybe we should do this:
   INCLUDEPATHS= \
    -I"/usr/local/include/wx-2.9" \
    -I"/usr/local/lib/wx/include/gtk2-unicode-debug-static-2.9" \
    -I"/usr/include/wx-2.9" \
    -I"/usr/lib/wx/include/gtk2-unicode-debug-static-2.9"
   Again, those paths help make sure itʼs only 2.9 and will fail with 2.8.
   wxWidgets 2.8 comes in ANSI and UTF-16, both wrong for us.  Itʼs
   tempting because itʼs so easily available as a package; a lot of people
   were frustrated by it until we started hardcoding 2.9 into the
   makefile.
