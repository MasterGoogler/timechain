   It would be nice if the listtransactions RPC method were finished
   before the next release, though.
   My fear is too many programmers would latch onto that for checking for
   received payments.  It can never be reliable that way.  The
   list/getreceivedbyaddress/label functions are the only way to do it
   reliably.
   We shouldnʼt delay forever until every possible feature is done.
   Thereʼs always going to be one more thing to do.
