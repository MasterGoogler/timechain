   So if your computer was only 1% towards solving block 68000
   This is a common point of confusion.  Thereʼs no such thing as being 1%
   towards solving a block.  You donʼt make progress towards solving it.
   After working on it for 24 hours, your chances of solving it are equal
   to what your chances were at the start or at any moment.
   Itʼs like trying to flip 37 coins at once and have them all come up
   heads.  Each time you try, your chances of success are the same.
   The RNG is the OpenSSL secure random number generator.  On Windows itʼs
   seeded with the complete set of all hardware performance counters since
   your computer started, on Linux itʼs dev/random.
