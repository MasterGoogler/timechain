   AMD X3 @2.8ghz

   ~3800khs ~150Watt
   Did you try -4way?

   How many hashes can I expect with a 24 core machine? I have a quad-core
   generating 4,300 hashes-per-second, so I am estimating a 24-core
   machine could mine bitcoins at 25,000 hashes-per-second.
   AMD Phenom (I think 4-core) CPUs are doing about 11,000khps with -4way,
   about 100% speedup.  24 cores should get 66,000khps.  AMD is the best
   choice because it has the best SSE2 implementation. (or maybe because
   tcatm had an AMD and optimised his code for that)
   Thereʼs been so much else to do that I havenʼt had time to make -4way
   automatic.  For now you still have to do it manually.
