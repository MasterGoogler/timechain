   Ok here is the .po file for French. While Iʼm at it, I noted a couple
   of issues:
   1. The "About" box didnʼt take the translation into account, it still
   displays the english version to me, even though the rest of the
   software is using the translated strings, and the .po file contains the
   translation string of the "About" box message. Same problem with the
   "Apply" button in the Settings window.
   I need to give an updated .po file.

   2. If an transactionʼs description in the list of transaction in the
   main window contains a diacritical character (such as "éàèç"), itʼs not
   displayed. I suppose the string is not being properly handled as UTF8
   somewhere.
   OK, this must be a problem somewhere, Iʼll have to take a look at it or
   one of the other devs can.

   4. About the .po file :
      - There are a few strings in the .po file that donʼt needs
   translation (ie: "Bitcoin"). Maybe those shouldnʼt be inside _("...") ?
      - Others shouldnʼt be split. I can remember one message about
   transaction fee where the string is split in two to insert the fee
   value, where you could simply have put a %s. It makes the message
   harder to translate as I had to go in the source to find exactly what
   was going on.
      - Some strings have whitespace at the end or start, which necessity
   is very debatable, and itʼs easy to miss in PoEdit.
   Many of the strings are in code automatically generated from
   uiproject.fbp where nothing can be done about these things.  I have a
   program I use to find all the spacing inconsistencies at the beginning
   and ending of strings in your .po file and manually fix them up before
   I upload them to SVN.
