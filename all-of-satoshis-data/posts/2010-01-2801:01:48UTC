   Yes, itʼs a technical limitation.  Sending by bitcoin address enters
   the transaction into the network and the recipient discovers it from
   the network.  You donʼt connect directly with them and they donʼt have
   to be online at the time.
   I very much wanted to find some way to include a short message, but the
   problem is, the whole world would be able to see the message.  As much
   as you may keep reminding people that the message is completely
   non-private, it would be an accident waiting to happen.
   Unfortunately, ECDSA can only sign signatures, it canʼt encrypt
   messages, and we need the small size of ECDSA.  RSA can encrypt
   messages, but itʼs many times bigger than ECDSA.
