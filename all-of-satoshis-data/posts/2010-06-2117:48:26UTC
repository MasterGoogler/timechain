Re: Dying bitcoins

   Lost coins only make everyone elseʼs coins worth slightly more.  Think
   of it as a donation to everyone.

   I wonder though, is there a point where the difficulty of generating a
   new coinbase is so high that it would make more sense to try to recover
   keys for lost coins or steal other peopleʼs coins instead?  The
   difficulty of that is really high so for now it makes a lot more sense
   to generate but I just wonder what the real figures are.. would that
   ever become more productive?  Maybe Satoshi can address this..
   Computers have to get about 2^200 times faster before that starts to be
   a problem.  Someone with lots of compute power could make more money by
   generating than by trying to steal.
