Re: Questions about Bitcoin

Bitcointalk

   1-3:
   For that level of anonymity you need to connect through TOR, which will
   be possible with version 0.2, which is only a few weeks away.  Iʼll
   post TOR instructions at that time.
   4:
   Version 0.1.5: backup the whole %appdata%\Bitcoin directory.
   Version 0.2: you can backup just wallet.dat.
   5:
   Nope.  The whole design is all about preventing that from working.
   6:
   Those coins can never be recovered, and the total circulation is less.
    Since the effective circulation is reduced, all the remaining coins
   are worth slightly more.  Itʼs the opposite of when a government prints
   money and the value of existing money goes down.
   7:
   Itʼs currently 29,296 blocks.  The circulation is the number of blocks
   times 50, so the current circulation is 1,464,800 bc.
   If you only have 24k blocks, it must not have finished the initial
   block download.  Exit bitcoin and start it again.  Version 0.2 is
   better/faster at the initial block download.
   8:
   Typically a few hundred right now.  Itʼs easy now but itʼll get harder
   as the network grows.
   9:
   Good question, itʼs TCP.  The website needs to be updated to say TCP
   port 8333.
   The port forwarding is so other nodes can connect to you, so it helps
   you stay connected because you are able to be connected with more
   nodes.  You also need it to receive payments by IP address.
   10:
   No, the other nodes wonʼt accept that.
   Being open source means anyone can independently review the code.  If
   it was closed source, nobody could verify the security.  I think itʼs
   essential for a program of this nature to be open source.
   11:
   Slower machines produce fewer coins.  Itʼs proportional to CPU speed.
   12:
   There are more coming.
   13:
   It uses a transactional database called Berkeley DB.  It will not lose
   data in a system crash.  Transactions are written to the database
   immediately when theyʼre received.
   14:
   For now, you can just multiply the total blocks by 50.  The Bitcoin
   network has been running for almost a year now.  The design and coding
   started in 2007.
