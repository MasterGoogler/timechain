Version 0.3.11 with upgrade alerts

Bitcointalk

2010-08-27 21:54:12 UTC - [11]Original Post

   Version 0.3.11 is now available.
   Changes:
   - Some blk*.dat checking on load
   - Built the -4way code with -march=amdfam10, which makes it a little
   faster
   - Warning if your clock is too far off
   - Warnings/errors/alerts can also be seen in the getinfo command
   - Alert system
   The alert system can display notifications on the status bar to alert
   you if youʼre running a version that needs to be upgraded for an
   important security update.
   In response to an alert, your node may also go into safe mode, which
   disables the following json-rpc commands (used by automated websites)
   to protect it from losing money until you get a chance to upgrade:
    sendtoaddress
    getbalance
    getreceivedbyaddress
    getreceivedbylabel
    listreceivedbyaddress
    listreceivedbylabel
   If you decide itʼs a false alarm and want to take your chances, you can
   use the switch -disablesafemode to re-enable them.
   This is an important safety improvement.  For a large segment of
   possible problems, this can warn everyone immediately once a problem is
   discovered and prevent them from acting on bad information.
   Nodes keep operating and do not stop generating in response to an
   alert, so old versions may still try to make a fork, but the alert
   system can make sure users are warned not to act on anything in the
   fork.
