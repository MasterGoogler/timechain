   When you send to a bitcoin address, you donʼt connect to the
   recipient.  You send the transaction to the network the same way you
   relay transactions.  Thereʼs no distinction between a transaction you
   originated and one you received from another node that youʼre relaying
   in a broadcast.  With a very small network though, someone might still
   figure it out by process of elimination.  Itʼll be better when the
   network is larger.
   If you send by IP, the recipient sees you because you connect to their
   IP.  You could use TOR to mask that.
   You could use TOR if you donʼt want anyone to know youʼre even using
   Bitcoin.
   Bitcoin is still very new and has not been independently analysed.  If
   youʼre serious about privacy, TOR is an advisable precaution.
