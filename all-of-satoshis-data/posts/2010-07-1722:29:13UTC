Re: Bitcoin snack machine (fast transaction problem)

   I believe itʼll be possible for a payment processing company to provide
   as a service the rapid distribution of transactions with good-enough
   checking in something like 10 seconds or less.
   The network nodes only accept the first version of a transaction they
   receive to incorporate into the block theyʼre trying to generate.  When
   you broadcast a transaction, if someone else broadcasts a double-spend
   at the same time, itʼs a race to propagate to the most nodes first.  If
   one has a slight head start, itʼll geometrically spread through the
   network faster and get most of the nodes.
   A rough back-of-the-envelope example:
   1         0
   4         1
   16        4
   64        16
   80%      20%
   So if a double-spend has to wait even a second, it has a huge
   disadvantage.
   The payment processor has connections with many nodes.  When it gets a
   transaction, it blasts it out, and at the same time monitors the
   network for double-spends.  If it receives a double-spend on any of its
   many listening nodes, then it alerts that the transaction is bad.  A
   double-spent transaction wouldnʼt get very far without one of the
   listeners hearing it.  The double-spender would have to wait until the
   listening phase is over, but by then, the payment processorʼs broadcast
   has reached most nodes, or is so far ahead in propagating that the
   double-spender has no hope of grabbing a significant percentage of the
   remaining nodes.
