Re: They want to delete the Wikipedia article

   Bitcoin is an implementation of Wei Daiʼs b-money proposal
   [12]http://weidai.com/bmoney.txt on Cypherpunks
   [13]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunks in 1998 and Nick Szaboʼs
   Bitgold proposal
   [14]http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.html
   The timing is strange, just as we are getting a rapid increase in 3rd
   party coverage after getting slashdotted.  I hope thereʼs not a big
   hurry to wrap the discussion and decide.  How long does Wikipedia
   typically leave a question like that open for comment?
   It would help to condense the article and make it less promotional
   sounding as soon as possible.  Just letting people know what it is,
   where it fits into the electronic money space, not trying to convince
   them that itʼs good.  They probably want something that just generally
   identifies what it is, not tries to explain all about how it works.
   If you post in
   [15]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bitcoi
   n please donʼt say "yeah, but bitcoin is really important and special
   so the rules shouldnʼt apply" or argue that the rule is dumb or unfair.
    That only makes it worse.  Try to address how the rule is satisfied.
   Search "bitcoin" on google and see if you can find more big references
   in addition to the infoworld and slashdot ones.  There may be very
   recent stuff being written by reporters who heard about it from the
   slashdot article.
   I hope it doesnʼt get deleted.  If it does, itʼll be hard to overcome
   the presumption.  Institutional momentum is to stick with the last
   decision.  (edit: or at least I assume so, thatʼs how the world usually
   works, but maybe Wiki is different)
