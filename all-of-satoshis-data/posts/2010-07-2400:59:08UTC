Re: JSON-RPC Multiple Invocations

   Obviously itʼs a bug that it repeats the header.
   I was trying to follow the 1.0 spec:
   [12]http://json-rpc.org/wiki/specification   It called for multiple
   invocation.
   I think they mean itʼs like this, but Iʼm not sure:
   Post:
   {"method": "postMessage", "params": ["Hello all!"], "id": 99}
   {"method": "postMessage", "params": ["I have a question:"], "id": 101}
   Reply:
   {"result": 1, "error": null, "id": 99}
   {"result": 1, "error": null, "id": 101}
   I canʼt remember where I think I saw that itʼs supposed to send back
   HTTP status 500 for an error reply.  If it contains multiple responses
   and one is an error, I wonder if that makes the status 500 for the
   whole thing, I guess so.  Maybe it should always return 200.  I think
   someone sounded like the 500 might be causing a problem.
   This probably gets fixed after 0.3.3.  Until then, just use single
   invocation.  I wonder if any JSON-RPC package even supports multiple
   invocation, probably not.
   It would be nice if we could pin down better how multiple-invocation is
   supposed to work, if at all, before trying to fix it, and whether
   returning HTTP status 500 for error response is right.
