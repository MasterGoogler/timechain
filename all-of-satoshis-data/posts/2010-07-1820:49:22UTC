JSON-RPC password

Bitcointalk

2010-07-18 20:49:22 UTC - [11]Original Post

   I uploaded to SVN my changes to add a password to JSON-RPC.  If youʼre
   set up to build, please test it.
   The -server switch is replaced with -rpcpw=<password>, which is also
   used with bitcoind.
   bitcoin -rpcpw=<password>    -- runs with JSON-RPC port open
   bitcoind -rpcpw=<password>   -- daemon with password
   If you have a better idea for the switch name, let me know, but keep in
   mind there will eventually be a password for encrypting the database
   too.  Iʼm not sure but I think they may want to use different passwords
   for the two.
   It gives a warning if you donʼt set a password.
   All commands now require the password as the first parameter.  Itʼll
   tell you that if you run "bitcoind help".
   The central code:
     // Check password
     if (params.size() < 1 || params[0].type() != str_type)
         throw runtime_error("First parameter must be the password.");
     if (params[0].get_str() != strRPCPassword)
     {
         if (strRPCPassword.size() < 15)
             Sleep(50);
         begin = strRequest.end();
         printf("ThreadRPCServer incorrect password attempt\n");
         throw runtime_error("Incorrect password.");
     }
   Any comments on these decisions?
   1) if (strRPCPassword.size() < 15) Sleep(50);  -- this means if itʼs a
   short password, itʼll wait 50ms after each attempt.  This might be used
   as a DoS attack, but I figured if itʼs a short password, itʼs more
   important to protect against brute force password scan.  This may tell
   outsiders whether the password is less than 15 characters, but less
   than 15 isnʼt all that noteworthy, most passwords are less than 15.  If
   you want to close the DoS possibility, just use a password 15
   characters or longer.
   2) begin = strRequest.end();  -- if itʼs a single request with multiple
   invocations, I throw away the rest if one has a bad password.  This is
   so you canʼt stuff it with millions of password attempts in one packet.
    What do you think, is this the right thing to do?  (multiple
   invocation is probably almost never used anyway)
   I also fixed the two duplicated commands listed in the help:
   getaddressesbylabel <pw> <label>
   getbalance <pw>
   getblockcount <pw>
   getblocknumber <pw>
   getconnectioncount <pw>
   getdifficulty <pw>
   getgenerate <pw>
   getinfo <pw>
   getlabel <pw> <bitcoinaddress>
   getnewaddress <pw> [label]
   getreceivedbyaddress <pw> <bitcoinaddress> [minconf=1]
   getreceivedbylabel <pw> <label> [minconf=1]
   help <pw>
   listreceivedbyaddress <pw> [minconf=1] [includeempty=false]
   listreceivedbylabel <pw> [minconf=1] [includeempty=false]
   sendtoaddress <pw> <bitcoinaddress> <amount> [comment] [comment-to]
   setgenerate <pw> <generate> [genproclimit]
   setlabel <pw> <bitcoinaddress> <label>
   stop <pw>
