Re: Version 0.3.18

   New transaction templates can be added as needed.  Within a few days,
   there will be plenty of GPU power that accepts and works on it.
   Network support will be thorough long before thereʼll be enough clients
   who understand how to receive and interpret the new transaction.
   Timestamp hashes are still already possible:
   txin: 0.01
   txout: 0.00  <appid, hash> OP_CHECKSIG
   fee: 0.01
   If thereʼs an actual application like BitDNS getting ready to actually
   start inserting hashes, we can always add a specific transaction
   template for timestamps.
   I like Hal Finneyʼs idea for user-friendly timestamping.  Convert the
   hash of a file to a bitcoin address and send 0.01 to it:

   I thought of a simple way to implement the timestamp concept I
   mentioned above. Run sha1sum on the file you want to timestamp. Convert
   the result to a Bitcoin address, such as via
   [13]http://blockexplorer.com/q/hashtoaddress . Then send a small
   payment to that address.
   The money will be lost forever, as there is no way to spend it further,
   but the timestamp Bitcoin address will remain in the block chain as a
   record of the fileʼs existence.
   I understand that this is arguably not a good use of the Bitcoin
   distributed database, but nothing stops people from doing this so we
   should be aware that it may be done.
