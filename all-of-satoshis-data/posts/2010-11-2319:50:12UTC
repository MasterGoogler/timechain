New getwork

Bitcointalk

2010-11-23 19:50:12 UTC - [11]Original Post

   I uploaded a redesign of m0mchilʼs getwork to SVN rev 189 (version
   31601)
   m0mchilʼs external bitcoin miner idea has solved a lot of problems.
   GPU programming is immature and hard to compile, and I didnʼt want to
   add additional dependencies to the build.  getwork allows these
   problems to be solved separately, with different programs for different
   hardware and OSes.  Itʼs also convenient that server farms can run a
   single Bitcoin node and the rest only run getwork clients.
   The interface has a few changes:
   getwork [data]
   If [data] is not specified, returns formatted hash data to work on:
     "midstate" : precomputed hash state after hashing the first half of
   the data
     "data" : block data
     "hash1" : formatted hash buffer for second hash
     "target" : little endian hash target
   If [data] is specified, tries to solve the block and returns true if it
   was successful.  [data] is the same 128 byte block data that was
   returned in the "data" field, but with the nonce changed.
   Notes:
   - It does not return work when you submit a possible hit, only when
   called without parameter.
   - The block field has been separated into data and hash1.
   - data is 128 bytes, which includes the first half thatʼs already
   hashed by midstate.
   - hash1 is always the same, but included for convenience.
   - Logging of "ThreadRPCServer method=getwork" is disabled, it would be
   too much junk in the log.
