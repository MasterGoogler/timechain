Re: 0.3 almost ready

   You figured it out faster than I could post a reply.   Smiley
   It looks like laszloʼs build of Berkeley DB has database/log.* files
   that are not compatible with ours.  The .dat files are fine, their
   format shouldnʼt ever change.  All data is stored in the .dat files.
   All your own data is stored in wallet.dat.  If you had waited for it to
   redownload the block chain, your missing transactions and generateds
   would have appeared as the block chain reached the point where those
   transactions were recorded.
   When you copied the directory except log.0000000002, thatʼs the best
   solution.  You should be good now.
   The database/log.* files only contain temporary database data.  If you
   exited bitcoin normally the last time, not exited by forced terminating
   it or crashing, then the database/log.* files can normally be deleted
   safely.  Theyʼre only used so that if the database is in the middle of
   a transaction when the computer crashes or the program is killed or
   crashes, then it could recover without losing data.
   Please keep running v0.3 if at all possible, donʼt go back to v0.2.10.
   Anyone else who hits this problem, move the database\log.000000000*
   files somewhere else.  (if it works fine after that, you can delete
   them later)
   Iʼm reluctant to make the installer delete or move those files.  If the
   previous run was stopped by crashing or killed, that would be the wrong
   thing to do.
