Re: Request: expected bitcoins per day display

   Many businesses are like that.  For a car salesman, when will the next
   customer walk in the door?
   On the OPʼs question, itʼs a good feature, but the question is, how
   would we word it so people donʼt expect to get something after that
   specific amount of time?  "it said 7 days and I waited more than a week
   and didnʼt get anything!"  Approx, average, but still theyʼre going to
   think that way.  It canʼt be a whole sentence, unless we think of
   somewhere else to put it, but where would that be?  Suggestions?
   The difficulty quadrupled a few minutes ago to 181.54.  Itʼs going to
   take typically about a week to generate now.
