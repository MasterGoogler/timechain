   Of course, if the network is not being flooded and youʼre not overly
   concerned about the current transaction getting held up then itʼs
   probably worth preferring to use your 0 conf transactions so that you
   can "save" the higher priority coins for when the network is being
   flooded.
   You should use at least some priority in case a flood comes along
   before the next block.
   As long as all dependencies have at least 1 conf, if the transaction
   doesnʼt have enough priority at first, the dependencies will age until
   it does.

   Gaming the system  by including 1000 or so recently turned over BTC to
   bump the priority as described in my post above still works of course!
   Or managing how much priority you spend on a transaction.  The software
   would have to know your future plans to know whether to spend your
   priority now or save it for later.  I donʼt think weʼll need to get
   into that much detail though.  Thereʼs a wide enough difference between
   normal users and flooders.
   Priority doesnʼt have to do everything.  Once you know thereʼs a flood,
   you can add -paytxfee=0.01.  Hopefully with priority, your transactions
   before that should be at worst slow, not stuck.
