Re: Cooperative mining

   ribuckʼs description is spot on.
   Pool operators can modify their getwork to take one additional
   parameter, the address to send your share to.
   The easy way for the pool operator would be to wait until the next
   block is found and divy it up proportionally as:
   userʼs near-hits/total near-hits from everyone
   That would be easier and safer to start up.  It also has the advantage
   that multiple hits from the same user can be combined into one
   transaction.  A lot of your hits will usually be from the same people.
   The instant gratification way would be to pay a fixed amount for each
   near-hit immediately, and the operator takes the risk from randomness
   of having more or less near-hits before a block is found.
   Either way, the user who submits the hit that solves the block should
   get an extra amount off the top, like 10 BTC.
   New users wouldnʼt really even need the Bitcoin software.  They could
   download a miner, create an account on mtgox or mybitcoin, enter their
   deposit address into the miner and point it at anyoneʼs pool server.
   When the miner says it found something, a while later a few coins show
   up in their account.
   Miner writers better make sure they never false-positive near-hits.
   Users will depend on that to check if the pool operator is cheating
   them.  If the miner wrongly says it found something, users will look in
   their account, not find anything, and get mad at the pool operator.
