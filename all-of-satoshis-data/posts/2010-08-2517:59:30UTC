   So what kind of warning do admins get from bitcoind? Is there something
   we can grep from debug.log? Or will rpc calls raise some specific
   error? Is there a way to locally force this to happen, for unittesting
   services?
   getinfo has a new field that shows any alert messages or other errors
   that would be displayed on the status bar.
   The rpc methods return a json-rpc error with the error description
   "Safe mode: " followed by additional text specified by the alert.
   I added the switch "-testsafemode" for you.  SVN rev 145.
   This stuff is very new and may still be subject to change.

   I just discovered [14]http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=man_page
   and donʼt see any reference to -disablesafemode.  Perhaps it should be
   added!  Also others liek -4way should be added as well.
   Many switches are intentionally undocumented, like if their
   functionality is still under construction or I havenʼt settled on their
   name yet, or just test code not intended for release.
   -4way should eventually be replaced by an auto-detect.
