   Helpful suggestions, thanks.

   - When the bitcoin software establishes a connection with a peer
   (client TCP socket) have the client send the handshake string. Right
   now you have the server (server TCP socket) send the handshake. My
   reasons for this are anonymity of course. It is far too easy for ISPs
   to portscan clients and detect they are running this program.
   Thatʼs a good idea.  The side accepting the connection just needs to
   withhold from sending anything until it receives a valid handshake.
   Any portscan would only get a dead connection that doesnʼt volunteer to
   identify itself.
   Quote
   - Use some sort of encryption during the handshake (sort of goes with
   the statement/request above) to obfuscate what the software is during
   DPI (deep packet inspection). I am really thinking about people in
   non-free (as in freedom) countries such as China/Iran.
   I have thought about eventually SSLing all the connections.  I assume
   anything short of SSL would be pointless against DPI.  Maybe a better
   more immediate solution is to connect through TOR, which will be
   possible with 0.2.

   - Some sort of an API is needed so that this system can be integrated
   with websites to provide instant-on services. A simple https receipt
   mechanism would do wonders. Have the client post each incoming payment
   to an https url with all of the relevant information and provide status
   updates. Also an outbound payment mechanism would be nice. So one could
   automate payments (and batch payments) outbound. Status could be
   returned via the https receipt interface.
   Thatʼs one of the main things on the agenda after 0.2.

   - Static port/Random port. Have a setting to randomly assign the port
   that it runs on. (also be able to set it statically for very
   restrictive firewalls).
   Yeah, the other stealth stuff would be kinda pointless if itʼs always
   the same port number.
   Quote
   - UPnP support. Have the client automatically create the port forward
   on upstream routers. Enabled by default. Can be turned off in the
   options menu.
   Iʼm looking forward to trying UPnP.  Do most P2P clients typically have
   UPnP enabled by default?
   Quote
   - Ability to compile a headless (console only) install for *NIX
   systems. Also have the ability to just run as a network service.
   Perhaps with a telnet-able port for control (or even a unix socket
   would be ok).
   Iʼm still thinking about how best to structure the management
   interface.  Maybe command line commands to communicate with the
   background daemon to query transactions received and initiate sending
   transfers.  That would be more automation friendly.  Or what about an
   http interface on some port other than 80 to manage it with a browser?
