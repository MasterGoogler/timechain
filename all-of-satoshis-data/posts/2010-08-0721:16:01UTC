   CRITICAL_BLOCK is a macro that contains a for loop. The assertion
   failure indicates that break has been called inside the body of the
   loop. The only break statement in this block is in line 2762. In the
   original source file, there is no break statement in this critical
   block. I think you must remove lines 2759-2762. The is nothing like
   that in the original main.cpp.
   Sorry about that.  CRITICAL_BLOCK isnʼt perfect.  You have to be
   careful not to break or continue out of it.  Thereʼs an assert that
   catches and warns about break.  I can be criticized for using it, but
   the syntax would be so much more bloated and error prone without it.
   Is there a chance the SSE2 code is slow on Intel because of some quirk
   that could be worked around?  For instance, if something works but is
   slow if itʼs not aligned, or thrashing the cache, or one type of
   instruction thatʼs really slow?  Iʼm not sure how available it is, but
   I think Intel used to have a profiler for profiling on a per
   instruction level.  I guess if tcatm doesnʼt have a system with the
   slow processor to test with, thereʼs not much hope.  But it would be
   really nice if this was working on most CPUs.
