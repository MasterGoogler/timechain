Re: RFC: ship block chain 1-74000 with release tarballs?

   Despite everything else said, the current next step is:

   Someone should experiment with different Berkeley DB settings and see
   if thereʼs something that makes the download substantially faster.  If
   something substantial is discovered, then we can work out the
   particulars.
   In particular, I suspect that more read caching might help a lot.

   Another new user on IRC, Linux this time, was downloading at a rate of
   1 block every 4 seconds -- estimated total download time around 4 days.
   Then something more specific was wrong.  Thatʼs not due to normal
   initial download time.  Without more details, it canʼt be diagnosed.
   If it was due to slow download, did it speed up after 10-20 minutes
   when the next block broadcast should have made it switch to a faster
   source?  debug.log might have clues.  How fast is their Internet
   connection?  Was it steadily slow, or just slow down at one point?

   We have the hashes for genesis block through block 74000 hardcoded
   (compiled) into bitcoin, so thereʼs no reason why we shouldnʼt be able
   to automatically download a compressed zipfile of the block database
   from anywhere, unpack it, verify it, and start running.
   The 74000 checkpoint is not enough to protect you, and does nothing if
   the download is already past 74000.  -checkblocks does more, but is
   still easily defeated.  You still must trust the supplier of the
   zipfile.
   If there was a "verify it" step, that would take as long as the current
   normal initial download, in which it is the indexing, not the data
   download, that is the bottleneck.

   Presumably at some point there will be a lightweight client that only
   downloads block headers, but there will still be hundreds of thousands
   of those...
   80 bytes per header and no indexing work.  Might take 1 minute.

   uncompressed data using a protocol (bitcoin P2P) that wasnʼt designed
   for bulk data transfer.
   The data is mostly hashes and keys and signatures that are
   uncompressible.
   The speed of initial download is not a reflection of the bulk data
   transfer rate of the protocol.  The gating factor is the indexing while
   it downloads.
