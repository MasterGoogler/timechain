Re: Hash() function not secure

Bitcointalk

2010-07-16 16:13:53 UTC - [11]Original Post

   SHA256 is not like the step from 128 bit to 160 bit.
   To use an analogy, itʼs more like the step from 32-bit to 64-bit
   address space.  We quickly ran out of address space with 16-bit
   computers, we ran out of address space with 32-bit computers at 4GB,
   that doesnʼt mean weʼre going to run out again with 64-bit anytime
   soon.
   SHA256 is not going to be broken by Mooreʼs law computational
   improvements in our lifetimes.  If itʼs going to get broken, itʼll be
   by some breakthrough cracking method.  An attack that could so
   thoroughly vanquish SHA256 to bring it within computationally tractable
   range has a good chance of clobbering SHA512 too.
   If we see a weakness in SHA256 coming gradually, we can transition to a
   new hash function after a certain block number.  Everyone would have to
   upgrade their software by that block number.  The new software would
   keep a new hash of all the old blocks to make sure theyʼre not replaced
   with another block with the same old hash.
