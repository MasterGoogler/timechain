   You can of course use services like vekja.net or mybitcoin.com on a
   mobile browser, depositing money there to the extent you trust them.
   I think thatʼs the best option right now.  Like cash, you donʼt keep
   your entire net worth in your pocket, just walking around money for
   incidental expenses.
   They could make a smaller version of the site optimized for mobile.  If
   there was an app, it could be a front end to one of those, with the
   main feature being QR-code reader, or maybe thereʼs already a universal
   QR-code reading app that web sites can be designed to accept scans
   from.
   If there was an iPhone app that was just a front end for vekja or
   mybitcoin, not a big involved P2P, would apple approve it and if not,
   on what basis?  It could always be an Android app instead.  An app is
   not really necessary though, just a mobile sized website.
   A web interface to your own Bitcoin server at home wouldnʼt be a
   solution for everyone.  Most users donʼt have a static IP, and itʼs too
   much trouble to set up port forwarding.
