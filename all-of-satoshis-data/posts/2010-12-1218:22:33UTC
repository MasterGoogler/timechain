Added some DoS limits, removed safe mode (0.3.19)

   Thereʼs more work to do on DoS, but Iʼm doing a quick build of what I
   have so far in case itʼs needed, before venturing into more complex
   ideas.  The build for this is version 0.3.19.
   - Added some DoS controls
   As Gavin and I have said clearly before, the software is not at all
   resistant to DoS attack.  This is one improvement, but there are still
   more ways to attack than I can count.
   Iʼm leaving the -limitfreerelay part as a switch for now and itʼs there
   if you need it.
   - Removed "safe mode" alerts
   "safe mode" alerts was a temporary measure after the 0.3.9 overflow
   bug.  We can say all we want that users can just run with
   "-disablesafemode", but itʼs better just not to have it for the sake of
   appearances.  It was never intended as a long term feature.  Safe mode
   can still be triggered by seeing a longer (greater total PoW) invalid
   block chain.
