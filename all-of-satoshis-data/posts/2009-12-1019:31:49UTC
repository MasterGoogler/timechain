   Front ends can also be ran on clients with very low cpu power such as
   mobile phones.
   Thatʼs a good approach for mobile.  Programmatic API used by PHP (any
   language) to present a web UI covers remote admin, mobile and any other
   client that canʼt be online all the time with a static IP.  It would be
   like webmail.  It would be easier for new users to get started if they
   only need to create an account on a website, not install software.

   The app could be pre-seeded before downloading. Pre-seeding would also
   cure the TOR+IRC problem. I know that people will want to run this
   system over I2P+TOR.
   Yeah, we can phase out IRC when there are enough static nodes to
   preprogram a seed list.  Once you get seeded, you donʼt need IRC.

   Also you could pre-seed the blocks so they wonʼt have to be downloaded
   upon initial run. (Downloading 28,000 blocks on a slower ADSL takes
   forever I couldnʼt imagine how long it would take when there are
   millions of blocks -- a lifetime).
   There were some issues in 0.1.5 where the initial block download could
   get bogged down.  0.2 has code to make sure it goes smoothly.  It ought
   to take less than an hour, I think.  I need to hurry up and get 0.2 out
   the door.
   The blocks increase linearly, itʼll be decades before itʼs millions.
   In theory, the block download time should top out 8 months from now
   when Mooreʼs Law will be growing faster than the block chain.

   Can you give me CVS access or something? (If not, can I send you
   patches?) Iʼd like to help out.
   Itʼs SVN on sourceforge.  PM or e-mail me your sourceforge account and
   Iʼll give you access.

   I am mostly a Linux/BSD guy and I would like to lend my expertise in
   those areas.
   Thatʼs great because thatʼs where I have less expertise.  For instance,
   I havenʼt researched the best way to do the "Start Bitcoin on system
   startup" feature on Linux.  On Windows, the option adds/removes an icon
   in the Startup folder.
