Re: Tor connections not working reliably, many seednodes offline

   Maybe you were just unlucky to have an exit node without reverse
   lookup.
   The IRC serverʼs response doesnʼt look like it was disconnecting you
   for that.  Itʼs supposed to go IRC SENDING: NICK after that, and it
   doesnʼt so it gets timed out.
   I see the problem.  The IRC code is looking for various phrases to see
   when the server is ready to receive your NICK, but itʼs not looking for
   that particular phrase.  Iʼll fix it.
   I donʼt know if itʼs really required to wait for the server to finish
   looking up hostname before sending nick.
   How long did it take to get connected with TOR the first time, having
   to use the seed nodes?
