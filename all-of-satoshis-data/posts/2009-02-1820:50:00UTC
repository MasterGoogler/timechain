Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency

   It is a global distributed database, with additions to the database by
   consent of the majority, based on a set of rules they follow:
   - Whenever someone finds proof-of-work to generate a block, they get
   some new coins
   - The proof-of-work difficulty is adjusted every two weeks to target an
   average of 6 blocks per hour (for the whole network)
   - The coins given per block is cut in half every 4 years
   You could say coins are issued by the majority. They are issued in a
   limited, predetermined amount.
   As an example, if there are 1000 nodes, and 6 get coins each hour, it
   would likely take a week before you get anything.
   To Sepp's question, indeed there is nobody to act as central bank or
   federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the population of users
   grows. That would have required a trusted party to determine the value,
   because I don't know a way for software to know the real world value of
   things. If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone
   to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules
   could have been programmed for that.
   In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the
   supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined
   and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin
   increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users
   increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take
   advantage of the increasing value.
