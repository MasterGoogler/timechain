Re: On IRC bootstrapping

   Everybody needs to connect to the same IRC server and channel so they
   can find each other.

   You may want to leave Freenode in as a fallback server -- if his server
   doesnʼt work, use Freenodeʼs.
   It might not be good if we suddenly rushed freenode with a ton of users
   all at once.
   The fallback is our own seed system.
   irc.lfnet.org is pretty old and has impressive uptime.  I think itʼs
   going to be fine.
   We could take IRC out at some point if we want, but Iʼd rather ease
   into it and just test our own seed system as a backup for now, and I
   really like the complementary redundant attributes of the two different
   systems.
