Re: Scalability and transaction rate

   The current system where every user is a network node is not the
   intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every
   Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting
   users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer
   nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The
   rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and donʼt generate.

   Besides, 10 minutes is too long to verify that payment is good.  It
   needs to be as fast as swiping a credit card is today.
   See the snack machine thread, I outline how a payment processor could
   verify payments well enough, actually really well (much lower fraud
   rate than credit cards), in something like 10 seconds or less.  If you
   donʼt believe me or donʼt get it, I donʼt have time to try to convince
   you, sorry.
