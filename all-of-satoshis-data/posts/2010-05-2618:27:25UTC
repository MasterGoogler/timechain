JSON-RPC programming tips using labels

Bitcointalk

2010-05-26 18:27:25 UTC - [11]Original Post

   I added label related functions to help with managing multiple
   addresses per user.  New or renamed functions are:
    getreceivedbyaddress -- amount received on a single address
    getreceivedbylabel -- amount received by all addresses with this label
    listreceivedbyaddress -- list addresses and amounts theyʼve received
    listreceivedbylabel -- list labels and amounts theyʼve received
    setlabel -- misc label functions for completeness
    getlabel
    getaddressesbylabel
   For consistency I renamed getamountreceived->getreceivedbyaddress and
   getallreceived->listreceivedbyaddress.  The old names are still there
   so as not to break existing code, but theyʼre deprecated.
   The idea is that if you give the username whenever you call
   getnewaddress, you can get the userʼs total received across all their
   addresses using the "bylabel" functions.  You can freely change their
   address without worrying about tracking all their old addresses.
   A good way to automate changing the userʼs receiving address: just
   before displaying their current address, check if it has been used to
   receive anything, if it has then replace it with a new one:
   // Get a new address whenever the current one has received anything
   if (strAddr == "" || getreceivedbyaddress(strAddr) > 0)
      strAddr = getnewaddress(strUsername); // Label the address with
   username
   Display(strAddr); // Display their current receiving address
   // Get total received by all the userʼs addresses
   getreceivedbylabel(strUsername, 0) // unconfirmed
   getreceivedbylabel(strUsername, 1) // available balance
   If youʼre just getting one particular userʼs balance, such as in
   response to a page request by that user, use getreceivedbylabel, but if
   youʼre scanning over all users, itʼs better to use listreceivedbylabel
   to get the complete list and scan against the result.  Scanning users
   with getreceivedbylabel would be n-squared, using listreceivedbylabel
   is n-log-n (or n linear).
   You should only really need to scan all users if youʼre polling in
   order to spontaneously take action in response to money received,
   rather than the user going to a webpage, seeing their balance and
   telling you what to do with it.  Itʼs not necessary to poll very
   frequently.  If you require 1 confirmation, thatʼll take an average of
   10 minutes anyway, so thereʼs no point in polling more often than every
   few minutes.
   If youʼre selling digital goods and services, where you donʼt lose much
   if someone gets a free access, and it canʼt be resold for profit, I
   think youʼre fine to accept 0 confirmations.
   Itʼs mostly only if you were selling gold or currency that youʼd need
   multiple confirmations.
