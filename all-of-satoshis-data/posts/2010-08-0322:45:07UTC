Re: What happens when network is split for prolonged time and reconnected?

   creighto: I agree with that idea.  After a few hours, it should be
   possible for the client to notice if the flow of blocks has dropped off
   by more than would be likely just by chance.  It could tell if itʼs not
   hearing the hum of the world anymore.

   Or if the split lasted long enough (more than 100 blocks), transactions
   that involve generated coins on the shorter chain would be invalid at
   the merge.
   Interesting info, so other than some double-spending issues, as long as
   the block chain isnʼt separated for more than 100 or so blocks (or 16+
   hours),
   In practice, splits are likely to be very asymmetrical.  It would be
   hard to split the world down the middle.  More likely it would be a
   single country vs the rest of the world, lets say a 1:10 split.  In
   that case, it would take the minority fork 10 times as long to generate
   100 blocks, so about 7 days.  Also it would be super easy for the
   client to realize itʼs hearing way too few blocks and something must be
   wrong.

   If there a hard coded limit on split delay? Meaning if I had a small
   network split from the public network, spent some coin around, came
   back a few days later and got them sync up to the public network (other
   than coin generation if it happened) transactions should be fine?
   Thereʼs no time limit.  Assuming you werenʼt spending coins generated
   in the minority fork, or spending someoneʼs double-spends you received,
   your transactions can get into the other chain at any time later.
