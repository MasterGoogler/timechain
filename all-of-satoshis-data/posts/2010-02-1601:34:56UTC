Re: Setting up multiple bitcoin machines behind NAT

Bitcointalk

2010-02-16 01:34:56 UTC - [11]Original Post

   Right now there isnʼt a port number setting to do that.  Itʼs a feature
   yet to be implemented.  You can only set up your NAT to port-forward to
   one of the computers.  (I said something earlier about NAT port
   translation, but that wouldnʼt work, other nodes wouldnʼt know to
   connect to that port)
   If you want, as a small optimization, you could run the rest of your
   computers as:
   bitcoin -connect=<the IP of the first computer>
   so they get all their network communication from the first computer and
   donʼt all connect over the net individually for the same information.
   This saves bandwidth, although it doesnʼt use much bandwidth to begin
   with, so it wouldnʼt really matter unless you had tons of computers.
   For redundancy in case the first computer goes down, you could have two
   that connect out and the rest connect to both of them.  The first two
   are run normally, the rest are run like:
   bitcoin -connect=<IP1> -connect=<IP2>
