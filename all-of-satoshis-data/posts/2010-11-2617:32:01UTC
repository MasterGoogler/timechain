Re: RFC: ship block chain 1-74000 with release tarballs?

   I tested it on a slow 7 year old drive, where bandwidth and CPU were
   clearly not the bottleneck.  Initial download took 1 hour 20 minutes.
   If itʼs taking a lot longer than that, certainly 24 hours, then it must
   be downloading from a very slow node, or your connection is much slower
   than around 15KB per sec (120kbps), or something else is wrong.  It
   would be nice to know what appears to be the bottleneck when that
   happens.
   Every 10 minutes or so when the latest block is sent, it should have
   the chance to change to a faster node.  When the latest block is
   broadcast, it requests the next 500 blocks from other nodes, and
   continues the download from the one that sends it fastest.  At least,
   thatʼs how it should work.

   Maybe Berkeley DB has some tweaks we can make to enable or increase
   cache memory.
   Which of the [14]ACID properties do you need, while downloading?
   It may only need more read caching.  It has to read randomly all over
   blk0001.dat and blkindex.dat to index.  It canʼt assume the file is
   smaller than memory, although it currently still is.  Caching would be
   effective, since most dependencies are recent.
   Someone should experiment with different Berkeley DB settings and see
   if thereʼs something that makes the download substantially faster.  If
   something substantial is discovered, then we can work out the
   particulars.

   Adding BDB records is simply appending to a log file, until you issue a
   checkpoint.  The checkpoint then updates the main database file.
   We checkpoint every 500 blocks.
