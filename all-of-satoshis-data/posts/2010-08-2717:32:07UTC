Re: Bitcoin does NOT violate Mises' Regression Theorem

   As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as
   gold but with the following properties:
   - boring grey in colour
   - not a good conductor of electricity
   - not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either
   - not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose
   and one special, magical property:
   - can be transported over a communications channel
   If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then
   anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some,
   transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.
   Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as youʼve suggested, by
   people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange.  (I would
   definitely want some)  Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark
   it.
   I think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the
   assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that
   are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value
   will surely win out over those without intrinsic value.  But if there
   were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as
   money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still
   take up something.
   (Iʼm using the word scarce here to only mean limited potential supply)
