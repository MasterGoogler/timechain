   It seems to do more harm than good because it prevents micropayment
   implementations such as the one bytemaster is suggesting.
   Bitcoin isnʼt currently practical for very small micropayments.  Not
   for things like pay per search or per page view without an aggregating
   mechanism, not things needing to pay less than 0.01.  The dust spam
   limit is a first try at intentionally trying to prevent overly small
   micropayments like that.
   Bitcoin is practical for smaller transactions than are practical with
   existing payment methods.  Small enough to include what you might call
   the top of the micropayment range.  But it doesnʼt claim to be
   practical for arbitrarily small micropayments.
