   Does the sending client send more BitCoins to account for the fee (so
   the recipient gets what heʼs expecting)?
   Yes.

   why do we even need fees ? i thougt the no-fees-feature was one of the
   advantages of bitcoin ?!
   Almost all transactions are free.  A transaction is over the maximum
   size limit if it has to add up more than 500 of the largest payments
   youʼve received to make up the amount.  A transaction over the size
   limit can still be sent if a small fee is added.
   The average transaction, and anything up to 500 times bigger than
   average, is free.
   Itʼs only when youʼre sending a really huge transaction that the
   transaction fee ever comes into play, and even then it only works out
   to something like 0.002% of the amount.  Itʼs not money sucked out of
   the system, it just goes to other nodes.  If youʼre sad about paying
   the fee, you could always turn the tables and run a node yourself and
   maybe someday rake in a 0.44 fee yourself.
