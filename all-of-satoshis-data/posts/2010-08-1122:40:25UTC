Re: Where is the separate discussion devoted to possible Bitcoin weaknesses.

   It doesnʼt have to be such a breaking change.  New nodes could accept
   old transactions for a long time until most nodes have already upgraded
   before starting to refuse transactions without PoW.  Or, they could
   always accept old transactions, but only a limited number per time
   period.
   Iʼve thought about PoW on transactions many times, but usually I end up
   thinking a 0.01 transaction fee is essentially similar and better.
   0.01 is basically a proof of work, but not wasted.  But if the problem
   is validating loads of transactions, then PoW could be checked faster.
   A more general umbrella partial solution would be to implement the idea
   where an unlikely dropoff in blocks received is detected.  Then an
   attacker would still need a substantial portion of the networkʼs power
   to benefit from a DoS attack.

   Bitcoinʼs p2p network is subject to various kinds of denial of service
   attacks.
   There, I said it.

   Any demonstration tests at this point would only show what we already
   know, and divert dev time from strengthening the system to operational
   fire fighting.
