Sample account system using JSON-RPC needed

Bitcointalk

2010-07-16 19:45:10 UTC - [11]Original Post

   We need someone to write sample code, preferably Python or Java,
   showing the recommended way to use the JSON-RPC interface to create an
   account system.  Most sites that sell things will need something like
   this.  Someone whoʼs kept up on the JSON-RPC threads here should have
   some idea how it should work.
   When a user is logged in to their account, you show the bitcoin address
   they can send to to add funds.  Before showing it, you check if itʼs
   been used, if it has then you replace it with a new one (getnewaddress
   <username>).  You only need to keep the latest bitcoin address for the
   account in your database.  (I posted a sample code fragment for this in
   an earlier thread somewhere, search on getnewaddress)
   You use getreceivedbylabel <username> with the username as the label to
   get the "credit" amount of the account.  You need to keep a "debit"
   amount in your database.  The current balance of the account is (credit
   - debit).  When the user spends money, you increase debit.
   If youʼre requiring more than 0 confirmations, itʼs nice if you show
   the current balance (0 confirmations) and the available balance (1 or
   more confirmations), so they can immediately see that their payment is
   acknowledged.  Not all sites need to wait for confirmations, so the
   dual current & available should be optional.  Most sites selling
   digital goods are fine to accept 0 confirmations.
   A nice sample app for this would be a simple bank site, which would
   have the above, plus the option to send a payment to a bitcoin
   address.  The sample code should be the simplest possible with the
   minimum extra stuff to make it a working site.
   vekja.net is an example of a site like this.
