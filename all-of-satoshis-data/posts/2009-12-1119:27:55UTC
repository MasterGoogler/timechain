Re: A few suggestions

   Right, the SVN has the almost-release-candidate 0.2 source, which can
   also be built and run on Linux.   It hasnʼt been tested on FreeBSD.

   If we can get to the point where we have a working backend process that
   will run on FreeBSD I can run always-on seeds.
   That would be a big help.  TOR users wouldnʼt have to worry about how
   to get seeded, and we wouldnʼt depend on IRC.
   It can be run in a few simple modes without access to the UI if you
   donʼt mind a minimized window on the desktop.  (0.1.5 doesnʼt have -min
   so it would be an open window)
   To only run a seed:
   bitcoin -min -gen=0
   You could sort of monitor it by looking at debug.log.  To stop it, kill
   the process, the database wonʼt mind.
   To generate:
   bitcoin -min -gen
   To get the generated bitcoins, youʼd have to copy wallet.dat (with
   version 0.2) to a machine with a UI, swap in the wallet.dat, run
   bitcoin and transfer the coins to your main account.  (With version
   0.1.5 youʼd have to copy the whole "%appdata%/Bitcoin" directory.)
   There is one caveat about copying wallet.dat: if you happened to kill
   the program at the exact moment that it generated a coin or received a
   payment, wallet.dat might not work by itself and youʼd have to copy the
   whole directory.

   I really think that having the download package contain a daily seed
   snapshot will improve the bootstrapping. I have seen instances on new
   test installs here where the application will sit with 0 connections /
   1 block. Upon inspecting the debug.log I find that the IRC server
   (freenode, I believe) claims I am already connected and refuses to let
   me seed the application. (Just an example).
   I see, that would happen with multiple nodes using the same NAT or VPN
   or some ISP that funnels everyone through a few proxy servers.  I just
   committed a fix to SVN for this.  If it gets "433" name already in use
   (it was error 433, right?), itʼll retry with a non-address random
   username.

   In any event, I would like to help. I have a lot of time and a project
   like this one is very exciting.
   Thatʼs great, any help is really appreciated!
