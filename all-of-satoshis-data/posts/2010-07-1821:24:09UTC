Re: MSVC build & SHA-256

   OpenSSL doesnʼt have any interface for doing just the low level raw
   block hash part of SHA256.  SHA256 begins by wrapping your data in a
   specially formatted buffer.  Setting up the buffer takes an order of
   magnitude longer than the actual hashing if youʼre only hashing one or
   two blocks like we do.  Itʼs intended that the time is amortised if you
   were hashing many KB or MB of data.  In BitcoinMiner, we format the
   buffer once and keep reusing it.
   If you can find SHA256 code thatʼs faster (with MinGW/GCC) than what
   weʼve got, that would be really great!  (although, keep licensing in
   mind)  The one we have is the only one I tried, so thereʼs significant
   chance for improvement.
   When I wrote it more than 2 years ago, there were screaming hot SHA1
   implementations but minimal attention to SHA256.  Thatʼs a lot of time
   for them to come up with better stuff.  SHA256 was a lot slower than
   the fastest SHA1 at the time than I thought it should be.  Obviously
   SHA256 should be slower than SHA1 by a certain amount, but not by as
   much as I saw.
   (hope you donʼt mind I renamed your thread, SHA-256 optimisation is
   something important that I keep forgetting about)
