Re: Flood attack 0.00000001 BC

   Forgot to add the good part about micropayments.  While I donʼt think
   Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will
   eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall.  If
   Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that
   time.  Another way they can become more practical is if I implement
   client-only mode and the number of network nodes consolidates into a
   smaller number of professional server farms.  Whatever size
   micropayments you need will eventually be practical.  I think in 5 or
   10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial.
   I am not claiming that the network is impervious to DoS attack.  I
   think most P2P networks can be DoS attacked in numerous ways.  (On a
   side note, I read that the record companies would like to DoS all the
   file sharing networks, but they donʼt want to break the
   anti-hacking/anti-abuse laws.)
   If we started getting DoS attacked with loads of wasted transactions
   back and forth, you would need to start paying a 0.01 minimum
   transaction fee.  0.1.5 actually had an option to set that, but I took
   it out to reduce confusion.  Free transactions are nice and we can keep
   it that way if people donʼt abuse them.
   That brings up the question: if there was a minimum 0.01 fee for each
   transaction, should we automatically add the fee if itʼs just the
   minimum 0.01?  It would be awfully annoying to ask each time.  If you
   have 50.00 and send 10.00, the recipient would get 10.00 and youʼd have
   39.99 left.  I think it should just add it automatically.  Itʼs trivial
   compared to the fees many other types of services add automatically.

   Does including more slow down your hashing rate?
   No, not at all.
