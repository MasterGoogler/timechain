   Payments would generally be advanced, say 1 BTC at a time and when the
   connection closes any "change" would be returned.  This rule makes it
   impossible to pay for a simple "search query" with no further
   transactions.
   One alternative is to use a round-up system.  You pay for, say, 1000
   pages or images or downloads or searches or whatever at a time.  When
   youʼve used up your 1000 pages, you pay for another 1000 pages.  If you
   only use 1 page, then you have 999 left that you may never use, but
   itʼs not a big deal because the cost per 1000 is still small.
   Or you could pay per day.  The first time you access the site on a
   given day, you pay for 24 hours of access.
   Per 1000 or per day may be easier for consumers to get their heads
   around too.  They worry about per item because itʼs harder to figure if
   it might add up too fast.  Unlimited for 24 hours they know what the
   cost will be.  Or if 1000 seems like plenty, theyʼre not worrying that
   itʼs costing more with each click if they figure 1000 is more than
   theyʼll probably use.
