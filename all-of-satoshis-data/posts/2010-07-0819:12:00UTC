   Itʼs hard to imagine the Internet getting segmented airtight.  It would
   have to be a country deliberately and totally cutting itself off from
   the rest of the world.
   Any node with access to both sides would automatically flow the block
   chain over, such as someone getting around the blockade with a dial-up
   modem or sat-phone.  It would only take one node to do it.  Anyone who
   wants to keep doing business would be motivated.
   If the network is segmented and then recombines, any transactions in
   the shorter fork that were not also in the longer fork are released
   into the transaction pool again and are eligible to get into future
   blocks.  Their number of confirmations would start over.
   If anyone took advantage of the segmentation to double-spend, such that
   there are different spends of the same money on each side, then the
   double-spends in the shorter fork lose out and go to 0/unconfirmed and
   stay that way.
   It wouldnʼt be easy to take advantage of the segmentation to
   double-spend.  If itʼs impossible to communicate from one side to the
   other, how are you going to put a spend on each side?  If there is a
   way, then probably someone else is also using it to flow the block
   chain over.
   You would usually know whether youʼre in the smaller segment.  For
   example, if your country cuts itself off from the rest of the world,
   the rest of the world is the larger segment.  If youʼre in the smaller
   segment, you should assume nothing is confirmed.
