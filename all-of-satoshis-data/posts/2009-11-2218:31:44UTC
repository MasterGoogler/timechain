   Bitcoin Maturation
   Posted:Thu 01 of Oct, 2009 (14:12 UTC)
   From the userʼs perspective the bitcoin maturation process can be
   broken down into 8 stages.
   1. The initial network transaction that occurs when you first click
   Generate Coins.
   2. The time between that initial network transaction and when the
   bitcoin entry is ready to appear in the All Transactions list.
   3. The change of the bitcoin entry from outside the All Transaction
   field to inside it.
   4. The time between when the bitcoin appears in the All Transfers list
   and when the Description is ready to change to Generated (50.00 matures
   in x more blocks).
   5. The change of the Description to Generated (50.00 matures in x more
   blocks).
   6. The time between when the Description says Generated (50.00 matures
   in x more blocks) to when it is ready to change to Generated.
   7 The change of the Description to Generated.
   8. The time after the Description has changed to Generated.
   Which stages require network connectivity, significant local CPU usage
   and or significant remote CPU usage? Do any of these stages have names?

   As far as I know, thereʼs no network transaction when you click
   Generate Coins - your computer just starts calculating the next
   proof-of-work.  The CPU usage is 100% when youʼre generating coins.
   In this example, the network connection is used when you broadcast the
   information about the proof-of-work block youʼve created (that which
   entitles you to the new coin). Generating coins successfully requires
   constant connectivity, so that you can start working on the next block
   when someone gets the current block before you.
