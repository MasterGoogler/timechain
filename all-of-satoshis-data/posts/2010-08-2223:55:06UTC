Development of alert system

Bitcointalk

2010-08-22 23:55:06 UTC - [11]Original Post

   Iʼve been working on writing the alert system.  Alerts are broadcast
   through the network and apply to a range of version numbers.  Alert
   messages are signed with a private key that only I have.
   Nodes can do two things in response to an alert:
   - Put a warning message on the status bar.
   - Make the money handling methods of the json-rpc interface return an
   error.
   In cases like the overflow bug or a fork where users may not be able to
   trust received payments, the alert should keep old versions mostly safe
   until they upgrade.  Manual users should notice the status bar warning
   when looking for received payments, and the json-rpc safe mode stops
   automated websites from making any more trades until theyʼre upgraded.
   The json-rpc methods that return errors during an alert are:
   sendtoaddress
   getbalance
   getreceivedbyaddress
   getreceivedbylabel
   listreceivedbyaddress
   listreceivedbylabel
