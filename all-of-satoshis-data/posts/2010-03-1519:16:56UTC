Idea for file hosting and proxy services

Bitcointalk

2010-03-15 19:16:56 UTC - [11]Original Post

   When you want to upload an image to embed in a forum post, there are
   services like imageshack, but because theyʼre free, they limit the
   number of views.  Itʼs a minuscule amount of bandwidth cost, but they
   canʼt just give it away for free, there has to be something in it for
   them.  It would be nice to be able to pay for the bandwidth and avoid
   the limits, but conventional payments are too inconvenient for such a
   minor thing.
   Itʼs worse if you want to upload a file for others to download.  There
   are services like rapidshare, but they require the downloaders to go
   through extra steps and delays to make them look at advertising or
   encourage upgrading to a paid subscription, and they limit it to 10 or
   so downloads.
   It would be nice if we made some free PHP code for an image and file
   hosting service that charges Bitcoins.  Anyone with some extra
   bandwidth quota could throw it on their webserver and run it.  Users
   could finally pay the minor fee to cover bandwidth cost and avoid the
   limits and hassles.  Ideally, it should be MIT license or public
   domain.
   Services like this would be great for anonymous users, who have trouble
   paying for things.
