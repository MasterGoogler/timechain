Escrow

Bitcointalk

2010-08-07 20:13:52 UTC - [11]Original Post

   Hereʼs an outline of the kind of escrow transaction thatʼs possible in
   software.  This is not implemented and I probably wonʼt have time to
   implement it soon, but just to let you know whatʼs possible.
   The basic escrow: The buyer commits a payment to escrow. The seller
   receives a transaction with the money in escrow, but he canʼt spend it
   until the buyer unlocks it. The buyer can release the payment at any
   time after that, which could be never. This does not allow the buyer to
   take the money back, but it does give him the option to burn the money
   out of spite by never releasing it. The seller has the option to
   release the money back to the buyer.
   While this system does not guarantee the parties against loss, it takes
   the profit out of cheating.
   If the seller doesnʼt send the goods, he doesnʼt get paid. The buyer
   would still be out the money, but at least the seller has no monetary
   motivation to stiff him.
   The buyer canʼt benefit by failing to pay. He canʼt get the escrow
   money back. He canʼt fail to pay due to lack of funds. The seller can
   see that the funds are committed to his key and canʼt be sent to anyone
   else.
   Now, an economist would say that a fraudulent seller could start
   negotiating, such as "release the money and Iʼll give you half of it
   back", but at that point, there would be so little trust and so much
   spite that negotiation is unlikely. Why on earth would the fraudster
   keep his word and send you half if heʼs already breaking his word to
   steal it? I think for modest amounts, almost everyone would refuse on
   principle alone.
