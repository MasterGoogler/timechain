Re: Flood attack 0.00000001 BC

   It would be nice to keep the blk*.dat files small as long as we can.
   The eventual solution will be to not care how big it gets.
   But for now, while itʼs still small, itʼs nice to keep it small so new
   users can get going faster.  When I eventually implement client-only
   mode, that wonʼt matter much anymore.
   Thereʼs more work to do on transaction fees.  In the event of a flood,
   you would still be able to jump the queue and get your transactions
   into the next block by paying a 0.01 transaction fee.  However, I
   havenʼt had time yet to add that option to the UI.
   Scale or not, the test network will react in the same ways, but with
   much less wasted bandwidth and annoyance.
