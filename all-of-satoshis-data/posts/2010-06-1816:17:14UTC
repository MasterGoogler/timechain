Re: Transactions and Scripts: DUP HASH160 ... EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG

   A second version would be a massive development and maintenance hassle
   for me.  Itʼs hard enough maintaining backward compatibility while
   upgrading the network without a second version locking things in.  If
   the second version screwed up, the user experience would reflect badly
   on both, although it would at least reinforce to users the importance
   of staying with the official version.  If someone was getting ready to
   fork a second version, I would have to air a lot of disclaimers about
   the risks of using a minority version.  This is a design where the
   majority version wins if thereʼs any disagreement, and that can be
   pretty ugly for the minority version and Iʼd rather not go into it, and
   I donʼt have to as long as thereʼs only one version.
   I know, most developers donʼt like their software forked, but I have
   real technical reasons in this case.

   I admire the flexibility of the scripts-in-a-transaction scheme, but my
   evil little mind immediately starts to think of ways I might abuse it.
    I could encode all sorts of interesting information in the TxOut
   script, and if non-hacked clients validated-and-then-ignored those
   transactions it would be a useful covert broadcast communication
   channel.
   Thatʼs a cool feature until it gets popular and somebody decides it
   would be fun to flood the payment network with millions of transactions
   to transfer the latest Lady Gaga video to all their friends...
   Thatʼs one of the reasons for transaction fees.  There are other things
   we can do if necessary.

   How long have you been working on this design Satoshi?  It seems very
   well thought out, not the kind of thing you just sit down and code up
   without doing a lot of brainstorming and discussion on it first.
   Everyone has the obvious questions looking for holes in it but it is
   holding up well Smiley
   Since 2007.  At some point I became convinced there was a way to do
   this without any trust required at all and couldnʼt resist to keep
   thinking about it.  Much more of the work was designing than coding.
   Fortunately, so far all the issues raised have been things I previously
   considered and planned for.
