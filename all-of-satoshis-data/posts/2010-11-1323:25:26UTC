   Thank you for limiting flood tests to the testnet.
   Version 0.3.15 combines several features to help legitimate
   transactions jump the queue during a flood attack.  The key was Gavinʼs
   idea for prioritising transactions based on the age of their
   dependencies.  Every coin is entitled to turn over so often.  The
   longer waited, the more priority accumulates.  Priority is sum(valuein
   * age) / txsize.  Transaction fee still takes precedence over priority,
   and priority determines the order of processing within a fee strata.
   In support of the priority feature, SelectCoins only uses your own 0
   conf transactions only as a last resort if thatʼs all you have left.
   This helps keep you from turning your coins over rapidly unless youʼre
   forcing it by actually turning all your coins over rapidly.
