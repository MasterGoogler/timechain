   Can you tell more about it:
   "they have to do weird things with extraNonce, which increases the size
   of the block header".
   When you generate, you calculate hashes of the block header. Hashing
   more data is slower than hashing less data, so the block header is
   critically of a fixed size for everyone, with one exception.
   This is the point of confusion.  extraNonce is not part of the block
   header, it is part of the first transaction.  It does not slow down
   your hashing.  It does not change the size of the header.
   We need to be vigilant and nip in the bud any misconception that the
   contents of your block slows down your hash speed.  It doesnʼt.
   extraNonce never needs to be very big.  We could reset it every second
   whenever the time changes if we wanted.  Worst case, if you didnʼt want
   to keep track of incrementing it, extraNonce could be 4 random bytes
   and the chance of wasting time from collision would be negligible.
   Separate machines are automatically collision proof because they have
   different generated public keys in the first transaction.  That also
   goes for each thread too.
