   Question about fallout:  I had a transaction that I submitted after the
   bad block, using the bad block chain.
   What is the status of that transaction?
   From what I can tell, my (updated) sending client wallet shows the
   deducted amount.
   Will it get reincorporated into the fixed chain, and will the recipient
   be able to spend it?
   Right, it will get reincorporated into the fixed chain.  The
   transaction wonʼt disappear, itʼll still be visible on both sides, but
   the confirmation count will jump back to 0 and start counting up again.
   Itʼs only if you generated a block in the bad chain after block 74638
   that the 50 BTC from that will disappear.  Any blocks in the bad chain
   wouldnʼt have matured yet.
