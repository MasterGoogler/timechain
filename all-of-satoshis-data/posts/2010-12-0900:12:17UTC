Re: JSON-RPC method idea: list transactions newer than a given txid

   Iʼm not talking about the normal risk for a given minconf level, Iʼm
   talking about additional pitfalls from listtransactions when used this
   way.

   2) When thereʼs a block-chain reorg, it would be easy to double-count
   transactions when they get confirmed again.
   The OPʼs example of listtransactions <account> [count=10] [txid] seems
   to imply and it would be very easy for programmers to assume that if
   they pass in the last txid of the previous call to listtransactions,
   they will never see the same transaction more than once, which is not
   the case.  It would be very easy to double-count payments if you donʼt
   maintain your own persistent map or dictionary to track which txidʼs
   youʼve already accepted.
   It doesnʼt seem right to have a function that seems tailor made to be
   used a certain obvious way, and that way is a non-obvious trap.

   3) A transaction can be replaced by a double-spend with a different
   txid.  You would count both spends.
   listtransactions does not add anything to this problem, beyond that
   which is already vulnerable through listreceivedbyaddress.
   Suppose both spends are to the same address.  getreceivedbyaddress
   would always count only one or the other spend at any given time, never
   both.
   Using listtransactions, it would be very easy to count both.  You see
   the first spend, you count it.  You see the second spend, you count it.
    Total is double counted.
