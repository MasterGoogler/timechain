   WxWidgets is not really a problem. My problem is the version that is
   used (2.9), which is considered unstable by many distro packagers
   (although the WxWidgets devs say it isnʼt). On the other side, as far
   as I know WxWidgets uses gtk under Linux for drawing the whole stuff
   and makes it for the bitcoins devs easy to make things cross platform.
   wxWidgets 2.9 is their first UTF-8 version.  We are UTF-8 on all
   platforms including Windows.
   The distro packages of 2.8 are UTF-16, so they just trip people up.
   People had endless build problems with 2.8 and its wxString UTF-16/ANSI
   conditional build options until we standardized on 2.9.  Also, to use
   2.8, we were using ANSI, which was just a temporary stopgap until
   wxWidgets supported UTF-8.
   This is a problem that will solve itself.  With time, 2.9 will become a
   more mainline release.
