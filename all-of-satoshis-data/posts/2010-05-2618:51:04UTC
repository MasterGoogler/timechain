   Canʼt we force a user to use a new address for receiving payments?
   Every time a payment is received display another Bitcoin address in the
   address bar. (only transactions via Bitcoin addresses, NOT IPs of
   course, since thatʼd be useless, right?)
   The actual key would still be kept to ensure that the user would still
   receive payments of people sending to the same address.
   This is on my list.  I will soon make the "Your Bitcoin Address:"
   window automatically change whenever you receive anything to the
   address displayed.
   Iʼm also recommending this approach for the implementation of web
   apps.  I just posted some sample code showing a suggested way of
   implementing this.
   Versions on SVN since 0.2.4 already have a "New..." button next to the
   address bar to encourage changing it manually too.
   @theymos: If nothing else, we can fall back on that solution in the
   future.
