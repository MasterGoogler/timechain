Re: Not a suggestion

   This is a very interesting topic.  If a solution was found, a much
   better, easier, more convenient implementation of Bitcoin would be
   possible.
   Originally, a coin can be just a chain of signatures.  With a timestamp
   service, the old ones could be dropped eventually before thereʼs too
   much backtrace fan-out, or coins could be kept individually or in
   denominations.  Itʼs the need to check for the absence of double-spends
   that requires global knowledge of all transactions.
   The challenge is, how do you prove that no other spends exist?  It
   seems a node must know about all transactions to be able to verify
   that.  If it only knows the hash of the in/outpoints, it canʼt check
   the signatures to see if an outpoint has been spent before.  Do you
   have any ideas on this?
   Itʼs hard to think of how to apply zero-knowledge-proofs in this case.
   Weʼre trying to prove the absence of something, which seems to require
   knowing about all and checking that the something isnʼt included.
