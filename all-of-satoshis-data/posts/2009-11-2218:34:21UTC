   Itʼs important to have network connectivity while youʼre trying to
   generate a coin (block) and at the moment it is successfully generated.
   1) During generation (when the status bar says "Generating" and youʼre
   using CPU to find a proof-of-work), you must constantly keep in contact
   with the network to receive the latest block. If your block does not
   link to the latest block, it may not be accepted.
   2) When you successfully generate a block, it is immediately broadcast
   to the network.  Other nodes must receive it and link to it for it to
   be accepted as the new latest block.
   Think of it as a cooperative effort to make a chain.  When you add a
   link, you must first find the current end of the chain.  If you were to
   locate the last link, then go off for an hour and forge your link, come
   back and link it to the link that was the end an hour ago, others may
   have added several links since then and theyʼre not going to want to
   use your link that now branches off the middle.
   After a block is created, the maturation time of 120 blocks is to make
   absolutely sure the block is part of the main chain before it can be
   spent.  Your node isnʼt doing anything with the block during that time,
   just waiting for other blocks to be added after yours.  You donʼt have
   to be online during that time.
