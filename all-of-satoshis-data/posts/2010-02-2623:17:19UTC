Re: New icon/logo

   Good suggestion.  I made the B slightly lighter and the background
   slightly darker.  Very slightly.  The foreground is now exactly the
   same colour as the BC in the old one.
   Itʼs kind of OK if you canʼt easily read the B in the 16x16.  At that
   size, you just need to see that itʼs a coin.  It doesnʼt matter so much
   whatʼs embossed on it, just that there be some detail there because it
   wouldnʼt look like a coin if it was a blank smooth circle.
   Itʼs slightly wider than tall because the dark perspective under it
   goes more to the right than down.
   I finished and posted the 32x31 and 48x47 versions in the first
   message.  I like the 48 a lot.
   How does everyone feel about the B symbol with the two lines through
   the outside?  Can we live with that as our logo?
