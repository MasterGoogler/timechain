   Satoshi, I figured it will take my modern core 2 duo about 20 hours of
   nonstop work to create ฿50.00! With older PCs it will take forever.
   People like to feel that they "own" something as soon as possible, is
   there a way to make the generation more divisible? So say, instead of
   making ฿50 every 20 hours, make ฿5 every 2 hours?
   I thought about that but there wasnʼt a practical way to do smaller
   increments.  The frequency of block generation is balanced between
   confirming transactions as fast as possible and the latency of the
   network.
   The algorithm aims for an average of 6 blocks per hour.  If it was 5 bc
   and 60 per hour, there would be 10 times as many blocks and the initial
   block download would take 10 times as long.  It wouldnʼt work anyway
   because that would be only 1 minute average between blocks, too close
   to the broadcast latency when the network gets larger.
