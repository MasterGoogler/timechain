   . Perhaps it has to do with my connectionʼs very high latency (2000ms
   or more on average)
   2 seconds of latency in both directions should reduce your generation
   success by less than 1%.

   and/or my high packet loss (sometimes up to 10% loss)?
   Probably OK, but Iʼm not sure.  The protocol is designed to resync to
   the next message, and messages get re-requested from all the other
   nodes youʼre connected to until received.  If you miss a block, itʼll
   also keep requesting it every time another blocks comes in and it sees
   thereʼs a gap.  Before the original release I did a test dropping 1 out
   of 4 random messages under heavy load until I could run it overnight
   without any nodes getting stuck.
