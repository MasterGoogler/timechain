   Looking through the source of 2.8.10 it appears that unicode is
   possible with that version too.
   In the Windows world, "unicode" means UTF-16 (wchar).
   2.8 has two build variations, ANSI and UTF-16 (unicode).  The UTF-16
   version is the "unicode" version provided in the Debian package.  I
   believe 2.8 and its UTF-16 build labelled simply "unicode" has been the
   source of build problems described in the forum.  We were previously
   using 2.8 ANSI in anticipation of getting to UTF-8 without going
   through UTF-16 hell.  We cannot compile with UTF-16.
   2.9 has only one version, UTF-8.  On Windows, we set the codepage to
   UTF-8, so on all platforms our code is UTF-8 and wxWidgets interfaces
   with us in UTF-8.  On Linux I assume the codepage is already UTF-8.  By
   standardizing on 2.9 we avoid the multi-build confusion of 2.8, and we
   need 2.9 for UTF-8 internationalization.
   Make sure you read build-unix.txt and configure wxWidgets using the
   configure parameters given.
   Curious, why is it incredibly hard to provide wxWidgets 2.9.0?  If you
   mean for users, thatʼs why we static link it.
   Itʼs unfortunate that we require so many big dependencies, but we need
   them all.  At least on Debian/Ubuntu, all but wxWidgets are available
   as packages.  Eventually theyʼll provide a 2.9 package.
