UI improvements

Bitcointalk

2010-02-21 21:48:01 UTC - [11]Original Post

   Uploaded some UI changes to SVN as version 0.2.5.
   Instead of View->Show Generated, we now have tabs:
   - All Transactions
   - Sent/Received
   - Sent
   - Received
   Makes it a lot easier to flip to received and check for payments.
   Moved the "Your Addresses" book inside the main address book.  It was
   confusing having two address books.
   I found the "To:" in "From: unknown, To: (one of your bitcoin
   addresses)" still confusing, so I changed it to "From: unknown,
   Received with:".  The bitcoin address is abbreviated so you can see the
   label that you set in the Receiving tab of the address book.
   Fixed a few UI glitches from the upgrade to wxWidgets 2.9.0.
   I havenʼt forgotten about you people who want non-UI, but I had to do
   some fun stuff before more build bashing.
