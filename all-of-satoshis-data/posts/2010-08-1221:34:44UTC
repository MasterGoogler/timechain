   True, there would probably be someone with a dial-up modem or satellite
   dish internet.  Rarer would be someone who has both that and the wired
   internet that has the outage, but if itʼs a big enough segment to
   matter, out of a million people thereʼs bound to be a multi-home geek.
   ISP network cuts are just your local area.  If you still have
   communication with the rest of your area, it would probably be
   something like 1/1000 of the world or less.  Block generation in the
   segment would take several hours per block.
   I favour the plan to monitor if the frequency of blocks received drops
   too slow.  That covers a large range of possibilities.
