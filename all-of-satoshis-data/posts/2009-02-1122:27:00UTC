Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency

P2P Foundation

2009-02-11 22:27:00 UTC - [10]Original Post

   I've developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin. It's
   completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties,
   because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust. Give it a
   try, or take a look at the screenshots and design paper:

   The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's
   required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to
   debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of
   breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and
   transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit
   bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with
   our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.
   Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.
   A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a
   similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on
   password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system
   administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always
   be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the
   principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his
   superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and
   trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was
   physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason,
   no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.
   It's time we had the same thing for money. With e-currency based on
   cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman,
   money can be secure and transactions effortless.
   One of the fundamental building blocks for such a system is digital
   signatures. A digital coin contains the public key of its owner. To
   transfer it, the owner signs the coin together with the public key of
   the next owner. Anyone can check the signatures to verify the chain of
   ownership. It works well to secure ownership, but leaves one big
   problem unsolved: double-spending. Any owner could try to re-spend an
   already spent coin by signing it again to another owner. The usual
   solution is for a trusted company with a central database to check for
   double-spending, but that just gets back to the trust model. In its
   central position, the company can override the users, and the fees
   needed to support the company make micropayments impractical.
   Bitcoin's solution is to use a peer-to-peer network to check for
   double-spending. In a nutshell, the network works like a distributed
   timestamp server, stamping the first transaction to spend a coin. It
   takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but
   hard to stifle. For details on how it works, see the design paper at
   [12]http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
   The result is a distributed system with no single point of failure.
   Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
   with each other, with the help of the P2P network to check for
   double-spending.
