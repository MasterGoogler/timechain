Still no .deb packages for Bitcoin?

That just means it failed to create a minidump, so yeah, not the cause of
the crash.

To find the cause of the crash you'd need to run it with a +seh,+relay trace
and find out what the app was doing before it crashed, or look in the
bitcoin logs.

I haven't had any reports of crashes in v0.1.5.  It's been rock solid 
for me on Windows.  I think it must be Wine related.  If you get another 
crash in Wine and it prints anything on the terminal, e-mail me and I 
may be able to figure out what happened, maybe something I can work 
around.  Martti and I have been working on a new version to release soon 
and it would be nice to get any Wine fixes in there.

Those don't look like anything to worry about.  Probably functions 
unimplemented by Wine that are harmlessly stubbed out.

You can delete debug.log occasionally if you don't want to take the disk 
space.  It's just status messages that help with debugging.

bitcoin.sourceforge.net looks fine now.  Maybe sourceforge was doing 
some maintenance.

[bitcoin-list] Does Bitcoin Crash in Windows?
From: Liberty Standard <newlibertystandard@gm...> - 2009-10-23 11:50:10
  Do you Windows users experience occasional Bitcoin crashes?

Lately Bitcoin running in wine-1.0.1 has been crashing frequently. I was
just wondering whether this is a Wine issue or a Bitcoin issue. I speculate
it might have something to do with how many Bitcoins I have since it would
crash less when I had less bitcoins and now crashes more now that I have
more bitcoins. It makes me hesitant to send my balance of bitcoins to my
fresh Bitcoin installation. But this might just be my imagination since it
has crashed a few times after installing Bitcoin afresh.

The following four lines print from the terminal when I start Bitcoin.
fixme:toolhelp:CreateToolhelp32Snapshot Unimplemented: heap list snapshot
fixme:toolhelp:Heap32ListFirst : stub
fixme:toolhelp:CreateToolhelp32Snapshot Unimplemented: heap list snapshot
fixme:toolhelp:Heap32ListFirst : stub

I previously wasn't starting Bitcoin from the terminal, so I don't know what
gets printed out when it crashes, but I'll reply with the results the next
time it crashes.

While Bitcoin first downloads previously completed blocks, the file
debug.log grows grows to 17.4 MB and then stops growing. I imagine it will
continue to grow as more bitcoins are completed.
