From: Jeff Kane <kanegs@gm...> - 2009-01-30 02:39:29
 Just an FYI that Bitcoin 0.1.3 works fine on Ubuntu 8.10 running Wine 1.0.1

Let me know if you have any questions.

What's the problem you're having?

If you send me your debug.log file directly (best not to send attachments
to the list), I can take a look at what's happening.

I would be surprised if 10 years from now we're not using
electronic currency in some way, now that we know a way to do it
that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the trusted third party
gets cold feet.

It could get started in a narrow niche like reward points,
donation tokens, currency for a game or micropayments for adult
sites.  Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications
for services that could almost be free but not quite.

It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail.  The send dialog is
resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.
It's sent directly when it connects.  The recipient doubleclicks
on the transaction to see the full message.  If someone famous is
getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to
have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and
give out the IP address on their website.  "Send X bitcoins to my
priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally."

Subscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their
free trial so it doesn't cannibalize subscriptions could charge
bitcoins for the trial.

It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on.  If
enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling
prophecy.  Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many
applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a
website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine.

[bitcoin-list] Bitcoin v0.1.3
From: Satoshi Nakamoto <satoshi@vi...> - 2009-01-12 22:48:23
 It looks like we're through with the worst of the Internet
connection issues.  0.1.3 fixed a problem where your node's
communications could go dead after a while.  The network is
running much more smoothly now with this version. 

If you've successfully generated a block, you've seen it has a
maturation countdown before you can spend it.  Once it matures,
the Credit column will change from 0.00 to 50.00.  For a block to
be valid, it has to be broadcasted to the network and get into the
block chain, which is why Generate does not run if you're not
connected.  If you generated a block without being connected, the
network wouldn't know about it and would continue building the
chain without it, leaving it behind, and the maturation countdown
would change to "(not accepted)" when your node sees that it
wasn't used.  If you subtract 1 from the status column, that's how
many blocks have been chained after yours.

[bitcoin-list] Bitcoin v0.1 Alpha release notes
From: Satoshi Nakamoto <satoshi@vi...> - 2009-01-12 20:20:47
 Release notes for Bitcoin v0.1 Alpha

Bitcoin is a new electronic cash system that uses a peer-to-peer 
network to prevent double-spending.  It's completely decentralized
with no server or central authority.
 
You can find screenshots and the download link at:
http://www.bitcoin.org
 
Windows only for now.  Open source C++ code is included.

- Unpack the files into a directory
- Run BITCOIN.EXE
- It automatically connects to other nodes

If you can keep a node running that accepts incoming connections,
you'll really be helping the network a lot.  Port 8333 on your
firewall needs to be open to receive incoming connections.

The software is still alpha and experimental.  There's no guarantee
the system's state won't have to be restarted at some point if it
becomes necessary, although I've done everything I can to build in
extensibility and versioning.

You can get coins by getting someone to send you some, or turn on
Options->Generate Coins to run a node and generate blocks.  I made
the proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so
for a little while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to
generate coins in just a few hours.  It'll get a lot harder when
competition makes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty.
Generated coins must wait 120 blocks to mature before they can be
spent.

There are two ways to send money.  If the recipient is online, you
can enter their IP address and it will connect, get a new public
key and send the transaction with comments.  If the recipient is
not online, it is possible to send to their Bitcoin address, which
is a hash of their public key that they give you.  They'll receive
the transaction the next time they connect and get the block it's
in.  This method has the disadvantage that no comment information
is sent, and a bit of privacy may be lost if the address is used
multiple times, but it is a useful alternative if both users can't
be online at the same time or the recipient can't receive incoming
connections.

Total circulation will be 21,000,000 coins.  It'll be distributed
to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half
every 4 years.

first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins
next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins
next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins
next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins
etc...

When that runs out, the system can support transaction fees if
needed.  It's based on open market competition, and there will
probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free.

[bitcoin-list] Bitcoin v0.1.2 now available
From: Satoshi Nakamoto <satoshi@vi...> - 2009-01-11 22:32:18
 Bitcoin v0.1.2 is now available for download.

See http://www.bitcoin.org for the download link.

All the problems I've been finding are in the code that
automatically finds and connects to other nodes, since I wasn't
able to test it in the wild until now.  There are many more ways
for connections to get screwed up on the real Internet.

Bugs fixed:
- Fixed various problems that were making it hard for new nodes to
see other nodes to connect to.
- If you're behind a firewall, it could only receive one
connection, and the second connection would constantly disconnect
and reconnect.

These problems are kind of screwing up the network and will get
worse as more users arrive, so please make sure to upgrade.

Congratulations to Satoshi on this first alpha release.  I am looking
forward to trying it out.

It's interesting that the system can be configured to only allow a
certain maximum number of coins ever to be generated. I guess the
idea is that the amount of work needed to generate a new coin will
become more difficult as time goes on.

One immediate problem with any new currency is how to value it. Even
ignoring the practical problem that virtually no one will accept it
at first, there is still a difficulty in coming up with a reasonable
argument in favor of a particular non-zero value for the coins.

As an amusing thought experiment, imagine that Bitcoin is successful and
becomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world.  Then the
total value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all
the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household
wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With
20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million.

So the possibility of generating coins today with a few cents of compute
time may be quite a good bet, with a payoff of something like 100 million
to 1! Even if the odds of Bitcoin succeeding to this degree are slim,
are they really 100 million to one against? Something to think about...

[bitcoin-list] Crash in bitcoin 0.1.0
From: Hal Finney <hal.finney@gm...> - 2009-01-10 19:13:18
Attachments: debug.log
Hi Satoshi - I tried running bitcoin.exe from the 0.1.0 package, and
it crashed. I am running on an up to date version of XP, SP3. The
debug.log output is attached. There was also a file db.log but it was
empty.

The crash allowed me to start up a debugger, but there were no
symbols. The exception was at address 00930AF7. The displayed call
stack was 942316 called by 508936.

When I have a chance, I'll try building it, although it looks like it
would take me a while to acquire all the dependencies.

Hal
