Yes - bitcoin kind of went dead.

The trouble is that bitcoin, to be useful, needs an ecology of users.

Long ago, I had an argument with the guy who designed it about scaling. 
  I heard no more of it - of course with no one using it, scaling is not 
a problem.  I do not know if the software is in useable condition, or 
has been tested for scaleability.

Bitcoin is a coordination mechanism between lots of people, and we do 
not have lots of people - I do not see how to get there from here, and 
am not altogether sure that the software as written will work if we do 
get there.

In order to be useful, needs to be integrated with a messaging and 
billing system, so that you can send messages containing bills or money. 
  I am pretty sure that no such system exists, and it is no small amount 
of work to create it.



It is a neat idea, to solve a problem

I think bitcoin is sufficiently worthwhile to remove as much friction
as possible, and increase number of applications which can use it for
online transactions.

I did not mean to sound so negative.  If we manage to get there from 
here, this is a huge win for liberty - but it is a long treck, and I 
have been busy with another project.

An untraceable pseudonym can be a contributing member of a list.  How
could it be a member of a forum?

Untraceability is maintained using chains of anonymizing remailers.
Authentication is contained in the message and does not depend on any
real-time end-to-end connection.  It's "message-based security" rather
than "connection-based security".

Is there a way for an untraceable pseudonym to join a forum?  Don't
answer "Tor".  Tor is traceable.  According to its own documentation

   ... for low-latency systems like Tor, end-to-end traffic
   correlation attacks [8, 21, 31] allow an attacker who can observe
   both ends of a communication to correlate packet timing and volume,
   quickly linking the initiator to her destination.

That is great to hear. So I can run the GUI one one host, connecting to
the binary as a daemon on another, right?

A lot of servers are headless, so an ssh connection is the only
reliable minimal assumption. I could in principle tunnel the GUI
over an X tunnel over ssh, but I'd rather not.

Please do not top-post.

It has been a while since I had a look at BitCoin. There's
still no Debian package, right?

I'm afraid the only way how I'd contribute would be to run a few nodes
once a Debian (amd64) package is there, and report bugs, if any.

I thought the project was dead. 

I don't do forums, only lists. You can kill the forum and keep the
list as far as I'm concerned.

 Hi,

Project communications have mostly moved to the Bitcoin Forum at  
http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/. Maybe this list is not needed anymore?

A headless version with CLI tools will be available in the next  
release, which will be out soon. There's a Linux binary, but no deb or  
rpm packages so far. It would be cool indeed if you could download  
Bitcoin from a package repository.
