The current version will work fine.  They'll each connect over the
Internet, while incoming connections only come to the host that
port 8333 is routed to. 

As an optimisation, I'll make a switch "-connect=1.2.3.4" to make
it only connect to a specific address.  You could make your extra
nodes connect to your primary, and only the primary connects over
the Internet.  It doesn't really matter for now, since the network
would have to get huge before the bandwidth is anything more than
trivial.

Indeed, Bitcoin is a distributed secure timestamp server for
transactions.  A few lines of code could create a transaction with
an extra hash in it of anything that needs to be timestamped.  
I should add a command to timestamp a file that way.

Exactly.
