That sounds good. I'd also like to be able to run multiple coin/block
generators on multiple machines, all behind a single NAT address. I
haven't tried this yet so I don't know if it works on the current
software.

BTW I don't remember if we talked about this, but the other day some
people were mentioning secure timestamping. You want to be able to
prove that a certain document existed at a certain time in the past.
Seems to me that bitcoin's stack of blocks would be perfect for this.

Right, and I'd like to see more of a library interface that could be
called from programming or scripting languages, on the client side as
well.

The next thing for v0.1.6 is to take advantage of multiple
processors to generate blocks.  Currently it only starts one
thread.  If you have a multi-core processor like a Core Duo or
Quad this will double or quadruple your production.

Later I want to add interfaces to make it really easy to integrate
into websites from any server side language.

[bitcoin-list] Bitcoin v0.1.5 released
From: Nicholas Bohm <nbohm@er...> - 2009-02-18 14:55:50
 Version 0.1.5 seems to be running trouble free.  I have a list of 201
transactions, I've accumulated about bc8550.  Transfers in and out seem
to work fine (after a bit of head-scratching to understand the labelling
of incoming transactions).

What's next?

Nicholas had, checking for disk full and changes to try to improve
things that were confusing.

Special thanks to Nicholas and Dustin for all their help and feedback!

    which confusingly changed the label for your own address
- moved change address button to menu under options
- tweaks to make it get connected faster
- close sockets on exit
- created minimum fee for transactions less than 1 cent
- hid the transaction-type selection box that only had one choice
- cleaned up ParseMoney a little
- slightly cleaner reformatting of message text
- changed the font in transaction details dialog
- added some explanation text to transaction details for generated coins
- reworded the description for transactions received with bitcoin address
