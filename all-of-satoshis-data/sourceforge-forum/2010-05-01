[bitcoin-list] New User

 Hello there,

I'm a new bitcoin user, and plan on accepting bitcoin currency for 
web-hosting that I run, because it sounds cool.

The build requirements for the main bitcoin app look a little painful, 
tho.  Is anyone working on CLI tools?  At the base, it's just manipulating 
a database, and running a computational program, right -- I don't see the 
need for the list of dependencies ubuntu tried to install when I followed 
the build instructions.

Also, having a native linux package would probably help a lot.  Has anyone 
built such a package?
